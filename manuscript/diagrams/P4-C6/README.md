# P4-C6 Policy Distillation - Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams for Chapter P4-C6: Policy Distillation.

## Diagram List

1. **figure-1-teacher-student-framework.mmd** - Teacher-student framework showing large teacher policy distilling to small student policy.

2. **figure-2-distillation-methods.mmd** - Comparison of distillation methods: behavioral cloning, feature matching, logit matching with characteristics and selection criteria.

3. **figure-3-privileged-information.mmd** - Privileged information concept: what teacher has access to vs what student can observe, and how distillation bridges the gap.

4. **figure-4-progressive-distillation.mmd** - Progressive distillation process: iterative compression from large teacher through medium to small student.

## Style Notes

- Diagrams use consistent color palette from global style guide
- Conceptual focus (no detailed neural network architectures)
- Emphasis on frameworks, methods, and workflows
- Black & white readable (colors are supplementary)

## Usage

These diagrams support the practical introduction to policy distillation in Part 4, showing how to compress large policies for efficient deployment.
