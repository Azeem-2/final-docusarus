# P4-C5 Trajectory Optimization - Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams for Chapter P4-C5: Trajectory Optimization.

## Diagram List

1. **figure-1-path-vs-trajectory.mmd** - Comparison of path (geometric) vs trajectory (with timing: positions, velocities, accelerations).

2. **figure-2-cost-functions.mmd** - Different cost functions: time-optimal, smoothness, energy-optimal, multi-objective.

3. **figure-3-optimization-methods.mmd** - Comparison of optimization methods: QP, nonlinear, direct collocation, shooting methods.

4. **figure-4-constraints.mmd** - Trajectory constraints: joint limits, obstacles, dynamic constraints.

## Style Notes

- Diagrams use consistent color palette from global style guide
- Conceptual focus (no detailed optimization algorithms)
- Emphasis on methods, comparisons, and constraints
- Black & white readable (colors are supplementary)

## Usage

These diagrams support the practical introduction to trajectory optimization in Part 4, showing how to optimize robot motion for smoothness, time, and energy.
