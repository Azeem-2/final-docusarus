# P5-C3 Balance & Stability - Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams for Chapter P5-C3: Balance & Stability.

## Diagram List

1. **figure-1-balance-metrics.mmd** - Balance metrics: ZMP, CoP, capture point, stability margins.

2. **figure-2-balance-strategies.mmd** - Balance control strategies: ankle strategy (small disturbances), hip strategy (medium), step recovery (large).

3. **figure-3-disturbance-rejection.mmd** - Disturbance rejection workflow: detect → assess → choose strategy → execute recovery.

## Style Notes

- Diagrams use consistent color palette from global style guide
- Conceptual focus (no detailed control algorithms)
- Emphasis on metrics, strategies, and workflows
- Black & white readable (colors are supplementary)

## Usage

These diagrams support the practical introduction to balance and stability in Part 5, showing how humanoid robots maintain balance and recover from disturbances.
