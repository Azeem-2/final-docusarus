# P4-C3 Control Policies - Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams for Chapter P4-C3: Control Policies.

## Diagram List

1. **figure-1-policy-architectures.mmd** - Comparison of policy architectures (MLP, CNN, Transformer, Diffusion) with use cases.

2. **figure-2-training-methods.mmd** - Training methods comparison: imitation learning, reinforcement learning, offline RL with trade-offs.

3. **figure-3-vision-based-control.mmd** - Vision-based control pipeline: image → vision encoder → policy → actions → execution.

4. **figure-4-multimodal-policy.mmd** - Multi-modal policy architecture showing fusion strategies (early, late, attention-based).

5. **figure-5-deployment-pipeline.mmd** - Complete deployment pipeline from training through optimization, inference, safety checks, to robot execution.

## Style Notes

- Diagrams use consistent color palette from global style guide
- Conceptual focus (no detailed neural network implementations)
- Emphasis on architectures, workflows, and integration
- Black & white readable (colors are supplementary)

## Usage

These diagrams support the practical introduction to learned control policies in Part 4, showing how neural network policies enable complex robot behaviors.
