# P2-C4 – Power Systems & Batteries Diagrams

This directory contains the core diagrams for Part 2, Chapter 4:

1. `figure-1-power-tree.mmd` – Example power tree for a small mobile robot (battery → BMS → switch → fuses → DC/DC converters → loads).  
2. `figure-2-chemistry-comparison.mmd` – Qualitative comparison of common battery chemistries (Li‑ion, LiFePO₄, NiMH, lead‑acid).  
3. `figure-3-runtime-estimation.mmd` – Conceptual flow from power budget and pack specs to a rough runtime estimate.  
4. `figure-4-safety-protection.mmd` – Simple safety chain showing fuses, main switch, and emergency stop between source and loads.

All diagrams follow the global Mermaid style guidelines in `.book-generation/style-guide/diagrams.md` and are intended to be rendered to SVG for the final manuscript.
