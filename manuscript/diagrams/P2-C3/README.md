# P2-C3 – Actuators & Motors Diagrams

This directory contains the core diagrams for Part 2, Chapter 3:

1. `figure-1-torque-speed-curve.mmd` – Conceptual torque–speed curve for a generic electric motor, illustrating the inverse relationship between torque and speed.  
2. `figure-2-gearmotor-exploded.mmd` – Exploded-style view of a gearmotor showing motor, gear stages, and output shaft.  
3. `figure-3-series-elastic-actuator.mmd` – Simple schematic of a series elastic actuator (motor → gearbox → spring → load).  
4. `figure-4-actuation-architectures.mmd` – Comparison diagram of actuation architectures (direct-drive, geared, SEA, hydraulic/pneumatic) and their qualitative trade-offs.

All diagrams follow the global Mermaid style guidance from `.book-generation/style-guide/diagrams.md` and are intended to be rendered to SVG for inclusion in the manuscript.
