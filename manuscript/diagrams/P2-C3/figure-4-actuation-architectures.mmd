%% Figure 4: Comparing Actuation Architectures
graph TD
  DD[Direct-Drive\n(high torque motor,\nno gearbox)] --> Uses1[High backdrivability\n+ precision,\n- heavy/expensive]
  GD[Geared Drive\n(motor + gearbox)] --> Uses2[+ Compact high torque,\n- less backdrivable,\n- more friction]
  SEA[Series Elastic\nActuator] --> Uses3[+ Safer contacts,\n+ better force control,\n- more complex control]
  HYD[Hydraulic/Pneumatic\nActuation] --> Uses4[+ Very high force density,\n- complex infrastructure]
