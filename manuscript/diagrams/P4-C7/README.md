# P4-C7 Language-to-Action Systems - Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams for Chapter P4-C7: Language-to-Action Systems.

## Diagram List

1. **figure-1-language-to-action-pipeline.mmd** - Complete language-to-action pipeline from natural language command through language/visual encoding, grounding, policy, to robot execution.

2. **figure-2-grounding-mechanisms.mmd** - Visual grounding (object, spatial) and action grounding (primitives, sequences) mechanisms.

3. **figure-3-end-to-end-vs-modular.mmd** - Comparison of end-to-end learning vs modular approaches with advantages and challenges.

4. **figure-4-challenges.mmd** - Key challenges (ambiguity, context, generalization) and their solutions.

## Style Notes

- Diagrams use consistent color palette from global style guide
- Conceptual focus (no detailed neural network architectures)
- Emphasis on workflows, comparisons, and challenges
- Black & white readable (colors are supplementary)

## Usage

These diagrams support the practical introduction to language-to-action systems in Part 4, showing how natural language enables intuitive human-robot interaction.
