# P2-C5 – Kinematics Diagrams

This directory contains the core diagrams for Part 2, Chapter 5:

1. `figure-1-planar-arm.mmd` – Two-link planar arm with base, joint, and end-effector labeled (L1, L2, θ1, θ2).  
2. `figure-2-planar-arm-workspace.mmd` – Qualitative depiction of the reachable workspace region for a planar arm (approximate ring).  
3. `figure-3-joint-vs-task-space.mmd` – Conceptual mapping from joint space (θ1, θ2) through forward kinematics to task space (x, y).  
4. `figure-4-redundancy-and-singularity.mmd` – Illustration of redundant configurations (elbow-up/elbow-down) and a singular configuration (fully stretched arm).

All diagrams follow the global Mermaid style guidelines in `.book-generation/style-guide/diagrams.md` and are intended to be rendered to SVG for the final manuscript.
