# P2-C6 – Dynamics Diagrams

This directory contains the core diagrams for Part 2, Chapter 6:

1. `figure-1-free-body-arm.mmd` – Free-body-style depiction of a simple arm link with joint torque and gravity acting on a payload.  
2. `figure-2-mobile-base-dynamics.mmd` – Conceptual dynamics of a differential-drive base showing wheel forces and resulting motion/turning.  
3. `figure-3-energy-landscape.mmd` – Qualitative energy/stability illustration using the pendulum analogy (low/medium/high energy states).  
4. `figure-4-friction-damping.mmd` – Conceptual comparison of ideal dynamics, high friction, and moderate damping and their qualitative responses.

All diagrams follow the global Mermaid style guidelines in `.book-generation/style-guide/diagrams.md` and are intended to be rendered to SVG for the final manuscript.
