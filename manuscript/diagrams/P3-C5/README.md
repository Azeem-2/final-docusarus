# P3-C5 Motion Planning in Simulation - Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams for Chapter P3-C5: Motion Planning in Simulation.

## Diagram List

1. **figure-1-configuration-space.mmd** - Configuration space concept showing how physical robot and obstacles map to C-space, where robot becomes a point and obstacles become regions.

2. **figure-2-rrt-growth.mmd** - RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) algorithm workflow showing tree growth through random sampling and extension.

3. **figure-3-sampling-vs-optimization.mmd** - Comparison of sampling-based and optimization-based planning approaches, showing trade-offs and hybrid approach.

4. **figure-4-planning-control-perception.mmd** - Integration of motion planning with control and perception, showing the closed-loop system and replanning trigger.

## Style Notes

- Diagrams use consistent color palette from global style guide
- Conceptual focus (no detailed algorithms or equations)
- Emphasis on workflows and relationships between components
- Black & white readable (colors are supplementary)

## Usage

These diagrams support the conceptual introduction to motion planning in Part 3, showing how planning algorithms work and integrate with control and perception systems.
