# P4-C4 Reinforcement Learning Advanced - Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams for Chapter P4-C4: Reinforcement Learning (Advanced).

## Diagram List

1. **figure-1-actor-critic.mmd** - Actor-critic method architecture showing actor (policy) and critic (value) networks.

2. **figure-2-ppo-sac-td3.mmd** - Comparison of advanced RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, TD3) with characteristics and use cases.

3. **figure-3-on-vs-off-policy.mmd** - Comparison of on-policy (PPO) vs off-policy (SAC, TD3) learning with advantages and disadvantages.

## Style Notes

- Diagrams use consistent color palette from global style guide
- Conceptual focus (no detailed neural network architectures)
- Emphasis on algorithms, comparisons, and workflows
- Black & white readable (colors are supplementary)

## Usage

These diagrams support the practical introduction to advanced RL algorithms in Part 4, showing how PPO, SAC, and TD3 enable stable, efficient robot learning.
