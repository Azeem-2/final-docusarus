# P3-C6 Simulation Toolchains - Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams for Chapter P3-C6: Simulation Toolchains.

## Diagram List

1. **figure-1-toolchain-vs-engine.mmd** - Comparison of simulation toolchains vs physics engines, showing that toolchains provide complete ecosystems beyond just physics.

2. **figure-2-platform-comparison.mmd** - Overview of three major platforms (Isaac Sim, Webots, Gazebo) with their best use cases and key features.

3. **figure-3-isaac-sim-workflow.mmd** - Isaac Sim workflow from scene creation to RL training, plus architecture components (Omniverse, USD, extensions, replicators).

4. **figure-4-workflow-comparison.mmd** - Side-by-side comparison of workflows for Isaac Sim (Python API), Webots (GUI-driven), and Gazebo (SDF + ROS2).

5. **figure-5-platform-selection.mmd** - Decision tree for platform selection based on use case, hardware, ecosystem needs, and team expertise, plus multi-platform validation.

## Style Notes

- Diagrams use consistent color palette from global style guide
- Conceptual focus (no detailed implementation or code)
- Emphasis on workflows, comparisons, and decision-making
- Black & white readable (colors are supplementary)

## Usage

These diagrams support the practical introduction to simulation toolchains in Part 3, showing how platforms differ, their workflows, and how to choose the right toolchain for a project.
