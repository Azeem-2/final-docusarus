# P3-C7 Sim-to-Real Transfer - Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams for Chapter P3-C7: Sim-to-Real Transfer.

## Diagram List

1. **figure-1-reality-gap.mmd** - The reality gap concept showing simulation vs physical performance, gap sources, and techniques to bridge the gap.

2. **figure-2-domain-randomization.mmd** - Domain randomization strategies (physics, visual, dynamics, environmental) and the training-to-transfer pipeline.

3. **figure-3-sim-to-sim-validation.mmd** - Sim-to-sim validation workflow: train in one simulator, test in others, iterate if needed.

4. **figure-4-teacher-student-distillation.mmd** - Teacher-student distillation process: teacher with privileged observations, student with real sensors, distillation steps.

5. **figure-5-complete-workflow.mmd** - Complete sim-to-real workflow from simulation training through physical deployment and iteration, including safety mechanisms.

## Style Notes

- Diagrams use consistent color palette from global style guide
- Conceptual focus (no detailed algorithms or equations)
- Emphasis on workflows, processes, and relationships
- Black & white readable (colors are supplementary)

## Usage

These diagrams support the practical introduction to sim-to-real transfer in Part 3, showing how to bridge the gap between simulation and physical robots.
