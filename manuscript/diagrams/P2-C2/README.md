# P2-C2 – Sensors & Perception Hardware Diagrams

This directory contains the core diagrams for Part 2, Chapter 2:

1. `figure-1-sensing-chain.mmd` – High-level flow from physical quantity to digital signal (transducer → analog signal → conditioning → ADC → controller).  
2. `figure-2-proprio-vs-extero.mmd` – Conceptual separation of proprioceptive vs exteroceptive sensors converging on the controller and actions.  
3. `figure-3-mobile-robot-sensor-layout.mmd` – Example sensor layout for a warehouse mobile robot, showing encoders, IMU, LiDAR, camera, and bump sensors.  
4. `figure-4-safety-redundancy.mmd` – Safety logic combining redundant sensors (e.g., LiDAR and bump switches) to issue safe-stop commands.

All diagrams follow the global Mermaid style guidelines in `.book-generation/style-guide/diagrams.md` and are intended to be rendered to SVG for the final manuscript.
