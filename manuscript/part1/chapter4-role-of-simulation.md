## 1. Introduction – Why Simulate?

(*Motivate simulation as a core tool; story of testing controllers safely and cheaply.*)

## 2. What Is Simulation in Robotics?

(*Define simulation models, physics engines, kinematic vs dynamic simulators; relate to P1‑C1 and P3‑C1.*)

## 3. Simulation Before Deployment – Design and Validation

(*Virtual prototyping of mechanisms, controllers, safety zones, and workspaces.*)

## 4. Simulation During Development – Debugging and Integration

(*Software‑in‑the‑loop and hardware‑in‑the‑loop; finding bugs before hardware damage.*)

## 5. Simulation for Learning – Data and RL

(*Simulation as data generator for RL and other learning methods; sim‑to‑real context.*)

## 6. Limitations – The Reality Gap

(*Where simulations diverge from reality; examples and mitigation strategies.*)

## 7. Digital Twins – Simulation in Operations

(*Preview digital twins as live, connected simulations; bridge to P1‑C5.*)

## 8. Simulation Toolchains and Platforms

(*Brief overview of major tools and ecosystems; no deep dive yet.*)

## 9. Educational and Experimental Workflows

(*How students and researchers actually integrate simulation into daily work.*)

## 10. Safety and Ethics in Simulation

(*Ethical and safety implications of relying on simulation; responsibilities of designers.*)

## 11. Connections to the Rest of the Book

(*Tie simulation’s role to Parts 2, 3, 4, and 6; show cross‑cutting importance.*)

## 12. Mini-Labs in Simulation

(*Short conceptual labs and exercises; link to lesson plan activities.*)

## 13. Key Takeaways

(*Bullet-style recap of simulation’s roles, benefits, and caveats.*)

## 14. Review Questions and Further Reading

(*Questions covering conceptual understanding and simple sim‑to‑real reasoning; curated readings.*)
