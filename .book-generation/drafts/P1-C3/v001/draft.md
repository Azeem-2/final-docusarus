## 1. Introduction – Why Humanoids Matter

(*Motivate humanoids as a recurring dream and now serious industrial focus; connect to public imagery and core questions from outline Section 1.*)

## 2. Early Concepts and Mechanical Precursors

(*Automata, mechanical figures, early cybernetics; how they shaped expectations.*)

## 3. First Generation – Research-Grade Walkers (ASIMO Era)

(*Describe ASIMO-era humanoids, goals, capabilities, and limitations.*)

## 4. Platform Era – Humanoids for Research Labs

(*HRP, Nao, and others as shared research platforms; communities and applications.*)

## 5. Dynamic Humanoids – Atlas and Beyond

(*Dynamic motion, whole-body control, and new behaviors enabled by improved hardware and control.*)

## 6. Towards General-Purpose Humanoids – Optimus, Figure, Apollo

(*Current wave of commercial humanoids; emphasis on manufacturability, cost, and use cases.*)

## 7. Enabling Technologies Across Generations

(*Actuation, sensing, control, and AI trends that cut across eras.*)

## 8. Economics, Markets, and Use Cases

(*Why commercial success has been difficult, and what’s different now.*)

## 9. Safety, Reliability, and Trust

(*Technical and social constraints on humanoid deployment.*)

## 10. Humanoids as Embodied Intelligence Case Studies

(*Link humanoids back to embodied intelligence and physical AI concepts.*)

## 11. Timeline and Generations

(*Concise narrative plus visual timeline summarizing phases and key platforms.*)

## 12. Mini-Case Studies: ASIMO, Atlas, Apollo

(*Three focused case studies comparing design goals, technologies, and outcomes.*)

## 13. Key Takeaways

(*Bullet-style recap of patterns and lessons from the evolution story.*)

## 14. Review Questions and Further Reading

(*Conceptual and analytical questions; curated survey papers and reports from research file.*)
