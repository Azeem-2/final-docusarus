## 1. Introduction – From Models to Twins

(*Motivate digital twins via a concrete factory or robot-cell example; pose the core “what’s different?” question.*)

## 2. Defining Digital Twins

(*Clear, student-friendly definition; emphasize live data and linkage to physical systems.*)

## 3. Types of Digital Twins

(*Asset, system, and environment twins with robotics/manufacturing examples.*)

## 4. Architectures and Data Flows

(*High-level architecture of sensors, data pipelines, models, analytics, and dashboards.*)

## 5. Digital Twins in Robotics

(*Robot-centric examples: twin of a robot arm, robot cell, mobile robot fleet, etc.*)

## 6. Applications in Manufacturing and Beyond

(*Predictive maintenance, throughput optimization, safety, training, etc.*)

## 7. Relationship to Simulation and Part 3

(*Explicit comparison with traditional simulation; bridge back to P1‑C4 and forward to Part 3.*)

## 8. Technology Stack – Data, Models, and Semantics

(*Introduce ingredients without going too deep: data, semantics, physics and data-driven models, AI.*)

## 9. Challenges and Limitations

(*Real-world constraints: data quality, calibration, integration complexity.*)

## 10. Economic and Organizational Considerations

(*Costs, benefits, and organizational roles in twin deployment.*)

## 11. Digital Twins and Embodied Intelligence

(*How twins help reason about embodied systems and environments; link to physical AI.*)

## 12. Simple Student Activities with Twins

(*Low-fidelity classroom activities and thought experiments; connect to lesson plan.*)

## 13. Key Takeaways

(*Bullet-style summary of definitions, types, architectures, and applications.*)

## 14. Review Questions and Further Reading

(*Questions and curated Tier 1 / Tier 2 sources from the research file.*)
