> NOTE: This is a scaffold draft generated from research, outline, and lessons blueprints. Some sections may be partial and will be expanded in later writer-agent passes.

## 1. Introduction

(*To be expanded into full prose following P1‑C2 outline, Section 1.*)

## 2. Motivation and Real-World Confusion

(*Why the terms are often mixed in media, industry, and research; connect to learner experience.*)

## 3. Learning Objectives

- Understand working definitions of **robotics**, **AI**, and **embodied intelligence**.  
- Distinguish between systems that are AI-only, robotics-only, and those that are examples of embodied intelligence.  
- See how these distinctions affect design, ethics, and careers.  

## 4. Key Terms

(*Robotics, artificial intelligence, embodied intelligence, physical AI, autonomy, policy, etc.; to be expanded with glossary-friendly definitions.*)

## 5. Defining Robotics

(*Embodied systems that sense, decide, act in the physical world; examples and non-examples.*)

## 6. Defining Artificial Intelligence

(*Algorithms and models for perception, reasoning, learning, planning; can be disembodied.*)

## 7. Embodied Intelligence and Physical AI

(*Body–brain–environment coupling; how morphology and environment participate in computation; connect to P1‑C1.*)

## 8. Overlaps and Venn Diagram View

(*Walk through overlapping sets; classify real systems; relate to Lesson 1 + 2 activities.*)

## 9. Case Studies: Chess Engine, Mobile Robot, Humanoid Assistant

(*Narrative comparison of three systems and how they sit in the Robotics/AI/Embodied sets.*)

## 10. Architecture Patterns – Where AI Lives in Robotics

(*High-level sense–plan–act vs AI-augmented architectures; connects to Lesson 3.*)

## 11. Ethics, Society, and Terminology

(*Why getting naming right matters for policy debates, public understanding, and responsibility.*)

## 12. Learning Pathways and Careers

(*Map interests to tracks: robotics engineer, ML engineer, embodied AI researcher, etc.; echo Lesson 4.*)

## 13. Summary and Key Takeaways

(*Short, bullet-style recap of definitions, overlaps, and implications.*)

## 14. Review Questions and Further Reading

(*Conceptual, scenario, and design questions; curated readings from research and outline.*)
