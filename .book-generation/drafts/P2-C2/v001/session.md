# Writing Session: Sensors & Perception Hardware (P2-C2)

**Date**: 2025-12-01  
**Word Count**: ~1,600  
**Time Spent**: ~2 hours  

## Voice Configuration Used

- Perspective: we  
- Tone: Balanced, introductory technical  
- Target Audience: students and practitioners new to robotics hardware and perception  

## Sections Completed

1. Introduction – Why Sensors Matter  
2. Sensing Basics – From Physical World to Signals  
3. Proprioceptive Sensors – Knowing the Robot Itself  
4. Exteroceptive Sensors – Knowing the Environment  
5. Mounting, Field of View, and Calibration  
6. Interfaces, Noise, and Latency (Conceptual View)  
7. Example Sensor Stacks for Common Robots  
8. Safety, Redundancy, and Health Monitoring  
9. Summary & Bridge to Perception Chapters  

## Research Sources Integrated

- Placeholder: detailed citations to be added from `.book-generation/research/sensors-and-perception-hardware/v001/research.md` in a later pass.

## Quality Notes

- Estimated Flesch Reading Ease: mid‑50s (appropriate for introductory technical content).  
- Paragraphs follow 4-part structure; transitions between sections are in place but can be further polished.  
- No explicit citations yet; [VERIFY] placeholders will be added when integrating specific numerical claims or standards.

## Notes for Editor

- Add concrete examples (short case studies) in the example stacks and safety sections.  
- Ensure terminology (e.g., FOV, latency, bandwidth, redundancy) lines up with glossary entries and later chapters.  
- Coordinate diagram references with `manuscript/diagrams/P2-C2/*.mmd` files when integrating figures.

## Next Chapter Preview

- P2-C3 (Actuators & Motors) will mirror this chapter’s structure: fundamentals, trade‑offs, and example stacks for different robot classes, with an emphasis on how actuation and sensing interact in control design.
