## 1. Introduction – Interacting with Humans

- Why HRI matters: Humanoid robots must work with humans.  
- Real-world motivation: Collaboration, assistance, companionship.  
- Key concepts: Communication, safety, trust, adaptation.

## 2. Interaction Modalities

- Speech: Natural language commands and responses.  
- Gestures: Hand and body gestures for communication.  
- Touch: Physical interaction and haptic feedback.  
- Vision: Understanding human actions and intentions.

## 3. Natural Language Interaction

- Speech recognition: Understanding human speech.  
- Language understanding: Interpreting commands and questions.  
- Speech synthesis: Generating natural responses.

## 4. Gesture Recognition

- Hand gestures: Recognizing hand movements.  
- Body gestures: Understanding body language.  
- Gesture-based commands: Using gestures for control.

## 5. Touch and Haptic Interaction

- Touch sensing: Sensing human touch.  
- Haptic feedback: Providing tactile feedback.  
- Physical interaction: Safe physical contact.

## 6. Vision-Based Interaction

- Human pose estimation: Understanding human body pose.  
- Action recognition: Recognizing human actions.  
- Intention prediction: Predicting human intentions.

## 7. Multi-Modal Interaction

- Combining modalities: Using multiple interaction modes.  
- Context awareness: Understanding interaction context.  
- Adaptive interfaces: Adapting to user preferences.

## 8. Safety and Trust in HRI

- Physical safety: Ensuring safe interaction.  
- Trust building: Building human trust.  
- Transparency: Making robot intentions clear.

## 9. Implementation: HRI Systems

- System architecture: Designing HRI systems.  
- Integration: Combining multiple modalities.  
- Evaluation: Testing and improving HRI.

## 10. Summary and Integration

- Key takeaways: HRI requires communication, safety, and trust.  
- Integration: Connects manipulation (P5-C4) to safety (P5-C6).  
- Bridge: HRI enables humanoid robots to work with humans.
