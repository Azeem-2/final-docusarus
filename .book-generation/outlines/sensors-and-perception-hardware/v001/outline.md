## Section 1: Introduction – Why Sensors Matter

**Purpose**: Motivate sensing as the foundation of all perception and control; connect to P1-C1–C2 concepts and to later perception/simulation chapters.  

---

## Section 2: Sensing Basics – From Physical World to Signals

**Purpose**: Explain how physical quantities (position, force, light, distance) become electrical and digital signals.  

---

## Section 3: Proprioceptive Sensors – Knowing the Robot Itself

**Purpose**: Cover encoders, IMUs, force/torque sensors, and joint sensing.  

---

## Section 4: Exteroceptive Sensors – Sensing the Environment

**Purpose**: Cover cameras, depth sensors, LiDAR, proximity sensors, and tactile skins.  

---

## Section 5: Mounting, Calibration, and Field of View

**Purpose**: Show how placement and calibration affect data quality and perception.  

---

## Section 6: Signal Quality, Noise, and Latency

**Purpose**: Introduce real-world imperfections and their impact on control and perception.  

---

## Section 7: Interfaces and Buses

**Purpose**: Briefly introduce electrical and communication interfaces (I2C, SPI, CAN, Ethernet, etc.).  

---

## Section 8: Safety and Reliability in Sensing

**Purpose**: Discuss redundancy, sensor health monitoring, and failure modes.  

---

## Section 9: Example Sensor Stacks for Common Robots

**Purpose**: Provide concrete sensor configurations for arms, mobile robots, and humanoids.  

---

## Section 10: Educational Labs and Mini-Projects

**Purpose**: Connect hardware topics to hands-on labs that will appear later in the book.
