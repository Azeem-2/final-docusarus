## 1. Introduction – Ensuring Safe Operation

- Why safety matters: Humanoid robots must operate safely.  
- Real-world motivation: Protecting humans and robots.  
- Key concepts: Collision avoidance, force limits, emergency stops.

## 2. Physical Safety: Collision Avoidance

- Collision detection: Detecting potential collisions.  
- Collision avoidance: Preventing collisions.  
- Safety zones: Defining safe operating zones.

## 3. Force Limits and Contact Safety

- Force limits: Limiting forces to safe levels.  
- Contact monitoring: Monitoring contact forces.  
- Safe contact: Ensuring safe physical contact.

## 4. Emergency Stops and Fail-Safe Design

- Emergency stops: Immediate shutdown mechanisms.  
- Fail-safe design: Systems that fail safely.  
- Redundancy: Backup systems for critical functions.

## 5. Safety Monitoring and Fault Detection

- Continuous monitoring: Monitoring safety conditions.  
- Fault detection: Detecting and responding to faults.  
- Safety diagnostics: Diagnosing safety issues.

## 6. Safety Standards and Regulations

- ISO standards: International safety standards.  
- Local regulations: Regional safety requirements.  
- Compliance: Meeting safety standards.

## 7. Safety in Different Scenarios

- Locomotion safety: Safety during walking.  
- Manipulation safety: Safety during manipulation.  
- Interaction safety: Safety during human interaction.

## 8. Safety System Architecture

- System design: Designing safety systems.  
- Integration: Integrating safety into robot systems.  
- Testing: Testing safety systems.

## 9. Best Practices for Safe Operation

- Operational procedures: Safe operation procedures.  
- Training: Training for safe operation.  
- Maintenance: Maintaining safety systems.

## 10. Summary and Integration

- Key takeaways: Safety requires monitoring, limits, and fail-safes.  
- Integration: Connects all Part 5 chapters (locomotion, balance, manipulation, HRI).  
- Bridge: Safety enables safe deployment of humanoid robots.
