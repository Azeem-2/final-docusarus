## 1. Introduction & Motivation

- Why RL is useful for robotics and control in simulation.  
- Simple examples: balancing, navigation, reaching.

## 2. RL Building Blocks

- Agent, environment, state, action, reward, episode.  
- Intuitive description of Markov decision processes.

## 3. Rewards and Objectives

- Reward shaping vs sparse rewards.  
- Common pitfalls and unintended behaviors.

## 4. Value-Based Methods (High Level)

- Intuitive view of Q-learning and value functions.  
- Simple gridworld or 1D example for intuition.

## 5. Policy-Based Methods (High Level)

- Policy gradient idea without derivations.  
- Actor–critic concept as a bridge to advanced methods.

## 6. Exploration & Stability

- Exploration strategies (ε-greedy-style intuition).  
- Importance of stable learning signals.

## 7. RL in Robotics Simulation

- Typical robotics tasks in simulation (locomotion, manipulation, navigation).  
- Why training happens in simulation first (safety, iteration speed).

## 8. Practical Considerations

- Episode design, resets, and curriculum-like progression.  
- Basic discussion of libraries/tooling at a conceptual level.

## 9. Safety and Ethics Preview

- Why blindly deploying RL policies to physical robots is risky.  
- Connection to later chapters on safety systems and sim-to-real.

## 10. Summary and Looking Ahead

- Recap of concepts and how they feed into P4-C4 (Advanced RL) and P3-C7 (Sim-to-Real Transfer).
