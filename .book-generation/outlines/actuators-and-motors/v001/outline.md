## Section 1: Introduction – Muscles for Robots

**Purpose**: Motivate actuators as the “muscles” of robots and link back to embodiment and Physical AI from Part 1.  

---

## Section 2: Actuator Fundamentals

**Purpose**: Explain torque, speed, power, efficiency, and duty cycle in intuitive terms.  

---

## Section 3: Electric Motors and Servos

**Purpose**: Cover brushed/brushless DC motors, stepper motors, and servo architectures used in common robots.  

---

## Section 4: Series Elastic and Compliant Actuators

**Purpose**: Introduce series elastic actuators and other compliant designs, especially relevant for humanoids and safe HRI.  

---

## Section 5: Hydraulic and Pneumatic Actuation

**Purpose**: Provide a high-level view of high‑power and soft‑robot actuation options and trade-offs.  

---

## Section 6: Power Transmission and Gearing

**Purpose**: Discuss gearboxes, harmonic drives, belts, cable/tendon drives, and their impact on backdrivability and control.  

---

## Section 7: Sensing Inside Actuators

**Purpose**: Explain encoders, current sensing, torque sensing, and integrated smart actuators.  

---

## Section 8: Safety, Reliability, and Thermal Limits

**Purpose**: Address failure modes, brakes, emergency stops, and safe actuator design in educational and industrial contexts.  

---

## Section 9: Actuator Choices Across Robot Types

**Purpose**: Provide examples of how arms, mobile bases, and humanoids select actuator technologies for different tasks.  

---

## Section 10: Labs and Mini-Projects

**Purpose**: Connect actuation concepts to hands-on labs and projects later in the book.
