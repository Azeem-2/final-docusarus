## 1. Introduction – Manipulating the World

- Why manipulation matters: Humanoid robots need to interact with objects.  
- Real-world motivation: Grasping, manipulating, using tools.  
- Key concepts: Grasping strategies, hand control, dexterity.

## 2. Grasping Strategies

- Power grasp: Full-hand grip for large objects.  
- Precision grasp: Finger-tip grip for small objects.  
- In-hand manipulation: Reorienting objects within hand.

## 3. Hand Kinematics

- Forward kinematics: Joint angles to fingertip positions.  
- Inverse kinematics: Fingertip positions to joint angles.  
- Hand workspace: Reachable positions and orientations.

## 4. Force Control and Tactile Sensing

- Force control: Controlling contact forces for stable grasping.  
- Tactile sensing: Sensing contact through touch sensors.  
- Force feedback: Using force information for manipulation.

## 5. Grasp Planning

- Object recognition: Identifying objects to grasp.  
- Grasp synthesis: Generating grasp configurations.  
- Grasp evaluation: Assessing grasp quality.

## 6. In-Hand Manipulation

- Object reorientation: Rotating objects within hand.  
- Finger coordination: Coordinating multiple fingers.  
- Manipulation primitives: Basic manipulation actions.

## 7. Tool Use

- Tool grasping: Grasping and holding tools.  
- Tool manipulation: Using tools to manipulate objects.  
- Tool exchange: Handing tools to humans.

## 8. Challenges in Dexterous Manipulation

- Object variations: Handling different objects.  
- Robustness: Reliable manipulation despite uncertainties.  
- Real-time control: Fast response for manipulation.

## 9. Implementation: Simulation and Physical

- Simulation: Testing manipulation in simulation.  
- Physical deployment: Deploying on real robots.  
- Sim-to-real transfer: Handling reality gap.

## 10. Summary and Integration

- Key takeaways: Manipulation requires grasping, force control, and dexterity.  
- Integration: Connects to locomotion (P5-C2) and interaction (P5-C5).  
- Bridge: Manipulation enables humanoid robots to interact with the world.
