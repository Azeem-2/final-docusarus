# Categories:
# - hardware: Physical components (sensors, actuators, motors)
# - software: Code, algorithms, frameworks
# - ai: Machine learning, RL, neural networks
# - simulation: Virtual environments, physics engines
# - mathematics: Equations, formulas, mathematical concepts
# - kinematics: Motion, position, velocity
# - dynamics: Forces, torques, inertia
# - control: PID, feedback, control theory
# - perception: Vision, sensing, data processing
# - safety: Safety protocols, hazards, precautions

# Complexity levels:
# - beginner: Foundational concepts (introduced in Part 1-2)
# - intermediate: Building on basics (Part 3-5)
# - advanced: Specialized/complex topics (Part 6-7)

# Validation rules:
# 1. No circular definitions (term A defines term B, term B defines term A)
# 2. Definitions must be beginner-friendly (avoid jargon in definitions)
# 3. first_introduced must be valid chapter_id (P{1-7}-C{1-N})
# 4. Each term appears only once (no duplicates)
# 5. related_terms must reference existing terms in glossary

# Usage:
# 1. When a chapter is published, extract all technical terms from "Key Terms" section
# 2. Add each new term to this file (check for duplicates first)
# 3. Cross-reference with existing terms to populate related_terms
# 4. Validate definitions for clarity and beginner-friendliness
# 5. Update metadata.total_terms and metadata.last_updated

# Export formats:
# - terms.yaml: Master source (this file)
# - terms.json: JSON export for programmatic access
# - terms.md: Markdown export for book appendix
# - terms-by-category.md: Organized by category
# - terms-by-complexity.md: Organized by complexity level
