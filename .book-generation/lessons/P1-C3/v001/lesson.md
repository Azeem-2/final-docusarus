## Lesson 1: Humanoid Dreams and Early Machines

- **Pedagogical Layer**: Layer 1 – Foundation (Remember/Understand)  
- **Estimated Time**: 60–75 minutes  
- **Prerequisites**: P1‑C1, P1‑C2; general familiarity with the idea of humanoid robots from media.  
- **Learning Outcomes**:  
  1. Describe at least three historical precursors to modern humanoid robots.  
  2. Explain why humanoid form has been a recurring goal.  
  3. Distinguish between animatronics/automata and true autonomous humanoids.  

### Part 1: Hook

- Students list 5 humanoid robots or fictional characters they know; classify as “fiction, research, product”.  

**AI Touchpoint 1 – Diagnostic Hook**  
- Prompt: *“Classify my list of humanoid robots into fiction, research prototype, or commercial product and correct any mistakes.”*  

### Part 2: Theory

- Short lecture: early automata, cybernetic ideas, and first research humanoids (e.g., WABOT, early bipedal prototypes).  

**AI Touchpoint 2 – Tutor**  
- Students ask for 3–4 sentence explanations of a chosen early project (e.g., WABOT-1).  

### Part 3: Walkthrough

- Timeline activity: groups place early milestones on a timeline, marking capabilities (walk, talk, manipulate).  

**AI Touchpoint 3 – Collaborator**  
- AI checks timelines for missing milestones and suggests one additional project to add.  

### Part 4: Challenge

- Students write a short paragraph: “Why did early humanoids focus so heavily on walking?” backed by at least one source.  

**AI Touchpoint 4 – SDD‑RI Challenge**  
- AI evaluates if the answer includes technical and social reasons, and suggests one missing angle.  

### Part 5: Takeaways

- Key distinctions between early mechanical figures, animatronics, and autonomous humanoids.  

### Part 6: Learn with AI

- RI component: `humanoid_history_summarizer`, which turns a list of milestones into a short, level‑appropriate summary.

## Lesson 2: From ASIMO to Dynamic Humanoids

- **Pedagogical Layer**: Layer 2 – Application (Apply)  
- **Estimated Time**: 70–90 minutes  
- **Prerequisites**: Lesson 1; basic understanding of kinematics and control from later Parts (to be referenced lightly).  
- **Learning Outcomes**:  
  1. Compare ASIMO-era humanoids with modern dynamic humanoids (e.g., Atlas).  
  2. Identify actuator, sensing, and control advances that enabled dynamic motions.  
  3. Explain trade‑offs between stability, agility, and complexity.  

### Part 1: Hook

- Show short clips or stills of ASIMO, Atlas, and Apollo; students jot down observable differences.  

**AI Touchpoint 1 – Diagnostic Hook**  
- Prompt: *“Given these descriptions of ASIMO and Atlas, list three key differences in capabilities and intended use.”*  

### Part 2: Theory

- Overview of:  
  - ZMP‑based walking and limitations.  
  - Whole‑body control and dynamic locomotion.  
  - Improved actuators and sensing.  

**AI Touchpoint 2 – Tutor**  
- Students ask: *“Explain zero-moment point (ZMP) to me in plain language with an everyday analogy.”*  

### Part 3: Walkthrough

- Students fill in a comparison table (ASIMO vs Atlas vs Apollo/Optimus) with dimensions like DOFs, actuation, control approach, energy source, environment.  

**AI Touchpoint 3 – Collaborator**  
- AI suggests plausible entries for missing cells and flags speculative values.  

### Part 4: Challenge

- Mini-design brief: “Design the next‑generation research humanoid—what capabilities should it prioritize and why?” (short spec, 250–300 words).  

**AI Touchpoint 4 – SDD‑RI Challenge**  
- AI reviews briefs for technical plausibility and coverage of sensing, actuation, and control.  

### Part 5: Takeaways

- Bullet summary of how technology shifts translated into new behaviors.  

### Part 6: Learn with AI

- Extend RI: `humanoid_comparator`, which given two humanoid descriptions, outputs a structured comparison and highlights research questions.

## Lesson 3: Markets, Use Cases, and Constraints

- **Pedagogical Layer**: Layer 3 – Analysis (Analyze/Evaluate)  
- **Estimated Time**: 70–90 minutes  
- **Prerequisites**: Lessons 1–2; basic awareness of industry applications (from P7‑C1) is helpful.  
- **Learning Outcomes**:  
  1. Analyze why humanoids struggled to find product–market fit historically.  
  2. Evaluate current proposed use cases (logistics, manufacturing, service) against constraints.  
  3. Identify at least three non‑technical factors that influence humanoid adoption.  

### Part 1: Hook

- Students brainstorm 5 jobs where they think a humanoid would be appropriate, then quickly rate feasibility.  

**AI Touchpoint 1 – Diagnostic Hook**  
- AI classifies proposed jobs into near‑term, mid‑term, and speculative based on current technology.  

### Part 2: Theory

- Short lecture: economics, safety, regulation, and maintainability.  
- Highlight demographic and labor trends driving renewed interest.  

**AI Touchpoint 2 – Tutor**  
- Students ask for explanations of one industry report excerpt (e.g., on labor shortages).  

### Part 3: Walkthrough

- Group case analysis: given a vendor case (e.g., warehouse or factory scenario), identify benefits, risks, and open questions.  

**AI Touchpoint 3 – Collaborator**  
- AI suggests missing benefits/risks and proposes one “red flag” question to investigate.  

### Part 4: Challenge

- Students choose one candidate job and write a short risk/benefit assessment for deploying a humanoid.  

**AI Touchpoint 4 – SDD‑RI Challenge**  
- AI audits the assessment for one‑sidedness (too optimistic or too pessimistic) and suggests balancing points.  

### Part 5: Takeaways

- Summary of market forces and constraints; emphasize that not all humanoid hype is justified.  

### Part 6: Learn with AI

- RI component: `humanoid_usecase_evaluator`, which scores a textual use case against feasibility, safety, and economic factors.

## Lesson 4: Humanoids as Embodied Intelligence Testbeds

- **Pedagogical Layer**: Layer 4 – Synthesis (Create)  
- **Estimated Time**: 70–90 minutes  
- **Prerequisites**: Lessons 1–3; P1‑C1 and P1‑C2 concepts of physical AI and embodied intelligence.  
- **Learning Outcomes**:  
  1. Connect humanoid evolution to embodied intelligence principles.  
  2. Propose a small research question or project idea using a humanoid platform.  
  3. Reflect on ethical, societal, and personal perspectives about humanoids.  

### Part 1: Hook

- Prompt: “In 10 years, do you think you will regularly interact with a humanoid robot? Where and why?”  

**AI Touchpoint 1 – Diagnostic Hook**  
- AI clusters answers into themes (home, work, never, uncertain) and surfaces representative quotes.  

### Part 2: Theory

- Tie back: morphology, control, perception, and learning in humanoids as rich embodied intelligence examples.  
- Brief note on humanoids’ role in research vs deployment.  

**AI Touchpoint 2 – Tutor**  
- Students ask: *“Give me an example of how body design simplifies control in a humanoid.”*  

### Part 3: Walkthrough

- Guided mapping: relate key concepts from P1‑C1 and P1‑C2 (embodiment, physical AI, robotics vs AI) to specific humanoid examples.  

**AI Touchpoint 3 – Collaborator**  
- AI helps complete a concept map linking humanoid platforms to embodied intelligence terms.  

### Part 4: Challenge

- Students draft a 1‑page **mini‑proposal** for a humanoid‑based research project or educational lab (e.g., balance experiments, HRI study).  

**AI Touchpoint 4 – SDD‑RI Challenge**  
- AI evaluates whether the proposal has clear goals, measurable outcomes, and realistic scope.  

### Part 5: Takeaways

- Final reflection on what humanoids teach us about building intelligent physical systems.  

### Part 6: Learn with AI

- RI component: `humanoid_project_ideator`, which generates and refines small, realistic project ideas given constraints (time, equipment, skill level).
