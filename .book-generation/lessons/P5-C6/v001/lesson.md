## Lesson 1: Physical Safety: Collision Avoidance and Force Limits

- **Pedagogical Layer**: Layer 1–2 – Intuition & Concepts  
- **Estimated Time**: 90–120 minutes  
- **Learning Outcomes**:  
  1. Understand collision avoidance for humanoid robots.  
  2. Explain force limits and contact safety.  
  3. Describe safety zones and monitoring.

### Parts 1–6

- **Hook**: A humanoid robot is moving near a human. How do we ensure it doesn't collide or apply dangerous forces?  
- **Theory**:  
  - **Collision avoidance**:  
    - Collision detection: Detecting potential collisions.  
    - Collision avoidance: Preventing collisions.  
    - Safety zones: Defining safe operating zones.  
  - **Force limits**:  
    - Limiting forces: Keeping forces below safe thresholds.  
    - Contact monitoring: Monitoring contact forces.  
    - Safe contact: Ensuring safe physical contact.  
- **Walkthrough**:  
  - Show collision avoidance: detection → planning → avoidance.  
  - Demonstrate force limits: monitoring → limiting → safe contact.  
  - Walk through safety zones: definition → monitoring → enforcement.  
- **Challenge**:  
  - Students design safety system:  
    1. Identify hazards (collisions, forces).  
    2. Design avoidance/limiting mechanisms.  
    3. Plan safety zones.  
- **Takeaways**:  
  - Collision avoidance prevents accidents.  
  - Force limits ensure safe contact.  
  - Safety zones provide operational boundaries.

## Lesson 2: Emergency Stops, Fail-Safe Design, and Safety Monitoring

- **Pedagogical Layer**: Layer 2–3 – Concepts & Application  
- **Estimated Time**: 90–120 minutes  
- **Learning Outcomes**:  
  1. Understand emergency stops and fail-safe design.  
  2. Explain safety monitoring and fault detection.  
  3. Describe redundancy and backup systems.

### Parts 1–6

- **Hook**: What happens when something goes wrong? How do we ensure the robot fails safely?  
- **Theory**:  
  - **Emergency stops**:  
    - Immediate shutdown: Stopping robot quickly.  
    - Emergency stop buttons: Manual activation.  
    - Automatic triggers: Conditions that trigger stops.  
  - **Fail-safe design**:  
    - Systems that fail safely: Default to safe state.  
    - Redundancy: Backup systems for critical functions.  
    - Fault tolerance: Handling component failures.  
  - **Safety monitoring**:  
    - Continuous monitoring: Real-time safety checks.  
    - Fault detection: Detecting and responding to faults.  
    - Safety diagnostics: Diagnosing safety issues.  
- **Walkthrough**:  
  - Show emergency stops: trigger → shutdown → safe state.  
  - Demonstrate fail-safe design: failure → safe default.  
  - Walk through safety monitoring: monitoring → detection → response.  
- **Challenge**:  
  - Students design fail-safe system:  
    1. Identify failure modes.  
    2. Design fail-safe mechanisms.  
    3. Plan monitoring and detection.  
- **Takeaways**:  
  - Emergency stops enable immediate shutdown.  
  - Fail-safe design ensures safe failures.  
  - Safety monitoring enables proactive safety.

## Lesson 3: Safety Standards, System Architecture, and Best Practices

- **Pedagogical Layer**: Layer 3–4 – Application & Integration  
- **Estimated Time**: 90–120 minutes  
- **Learning Outcomes**:  
  1. Understand safety standards and regulations.  
  2. Explain safety system architecture.  
  3. Describe best practices for safe operation.

### Parts 1–6

- **Hook**: Safety systems work, but how do we ensure they meet standards and are properly integrated?  
- **Theory**:  
  - **Safety standards**:  
    - ISO standards: International safety standards for robots.  
    - Local regulations: Regional safety requirements.  
    - Compliance: Meeting safety standards.  
  - **Safety system architecture**:  
    - System design: Designing integrated safety systems.  
    - Integration: Integrating safety into robot systems.  
    - Testing: Testing safety systems.  
  - **Best practices**:  
    - Operational procedures: Safe operation procedures.  
    - Training: Training for safe operation.  
    - Maintenance: Maintaining safety systems.  
- **Walkthrough**:  
  - Show safety standards: ISO → regulations → compliance.  
  - Demonstrate system architecture: design → integration → testing.  
  - Walk through best practices: procedures → training → maintenance.  
- **Challenge**:  
  - Students design safety compliance:  
    1. Identify applicable standards.  
    2. Design compliant system.  
    3. Plan testing and validation.  
- **Takeaways**:  
  - Safety standards ensure minimum safety levels.  
  - System architecture enables integrated safety.  
  - Best practices ensure ongoing safety.  
- **Learn with AI**:  
  - `safety_compliance_designer`: RI component that helps students design compliant safety systems.
