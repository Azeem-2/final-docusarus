## Lesson 1: Interaction Modalities: Speech and Gestures

- **Pedagogical Layer**: Layer 1–2 – Intuition & Concepts  
- **Estimated Time**: 90–120 minutes  
- **Learning Outcomes**:  
  1. Understand interaction modalities (speech, gestures).  
  2. Explain natural language interaction.  
  3. Describe gesture recognition and interpretation.

### Parts 1–6

- **Hook**: A human wants to tell a robot what to do. How do we enable natural communication?  
- **Theory**:  
  - **Speech interaction**:  
    - Speech recognition: Understanding human speech.  
    - Language understanding: Interpreting commands.  
    - Speech synthesis: Generating natural responses.  
  - **Gesture interaction**:  
    - Hand gestures: Recognizing hand movements.  
    - Body gestures: Understanding body language.  
    - Gesture-based commands: Using gestures for control.  
- **Walkthrough**:  
  - Show speech interaction: command → recognition → action.  
  - Demonstrate gesture recognition: gesture → interpretation → action.  
  - Compare modalities: when to use each.  
- **Challenge**:  
  - Students design interaction:  
    1. Identify task (command, question).  
    2. Choose modality (speech, gesture).  
    3. Design interaction flow.  
- **Takeaways**:  
  - Speech enables natural language communication.  
  - Gestures provide intuitive control.  
  - Different modalities suit different scenarios.  
- **Learn with AI**:  
  - `hri_modality_designer`: RI component that helps students design interaction modalities.

## Lesson 2: Touch, Vision, and Multi-Modal Interaction

- **Pedagogical Layer**: Layer 2–3 – Concepts & Application  
- **Estimated Time**: 90–120 minutes  
- **Learning Outcomes**:  
  1. Understand touch and haptic interaction.  
  2. Explain vision-based interaction.  
  3. Describe multi-modal interaction design.

### Parts 1–6

- **Hook**: Speech and gestures work, but can we add touch and vision for richer interaction?  
- **Theory**:  
  - **Touch interaction**:  
    - Touch sensing: Sensing human touch.  
    - Haptic feedback: Providing tactile feedback.  
    - Physical interaction: Safe physical contact.  
  - **Vision-based interaction**:  
    - Human pose estimation: Understanding body pose.  
    - Action recognition: Recognizing human actions.  
    - Intention prediction: Predicting human intentions.  
  - **Multi-modal interaction**:  
    - Combining modalities: Using multiple modes together.  
    - Context awareness: Understanding interaction context.  
    - Adaptive interfaces: Adapting to user preferences.  
- **Walkthrough**:  
  - Show touch interaction: touch → sensing → response.  
  - Demonstrate vision-based interaction: pose → action → intention.  
  - Walk through multi-modal: combining speech + gesture + vision.  
- **Challenge**:  
  - Students design multi-modal interaction:  
    1. Identify task requirements.  
    2. Choose multiple modalities.  
    3. Design integration.  
- **Takeaways**:  
  - Touch enables physical interaction.  
  - Vision enables understanding of human actions.  
  - Multi-modal interaction is more robust.  
- **Learn with AI**:  
  - `multimodal_hri_designer`: RI component that helps students design multi-modal HRI systems.

## Lesson 3: Safety, Trust, and HRI System Implementation

- **Pedagogical Layer**: Layer 3–4 – Application & Integration  
- **Estimated Time**: 90–120 minutes  
- **Learning Outcomes**:  
  1. Understand safety and trust in HRI.  
  2. Explain HRI system architecture.  
  3. Describe implementation and evaluation.

### Parts 1–6

- **Hook**: Interaction works, but how do we ensure it's safe and trustworthy?  
- **Theory**:  
  - **Safety in HRI**:  
    - Physical safety: Ensuring safe interaction.  
    - Psychological safety: Making humans feel safe.  
    - Safety monitoring: Continuous safety checks.  
  - **Trust building**:  
    - Reliable behavior: Consistent, predictable actions.  
    - Transparency: Making robot intentions clear.  
    - Error recovery: Handling mistakes gracefully.  
  - **HRI system implementation**:  
    - System architecture: Designing HRI systems.  
    - Integration: Combining multiple modalities.  
    - Evaluation: Testing and improving HRI.  
- **Walkthrough**:  
  - Show safety mechanisms: monitoring → detection → response.  
  - Demonstrate trust building: transparency → reliability → recovery.  
  - Walk through system implementation: architecture → integration → evaluation.  
- **Challenge**:  
  - Students design HRI system:  
    1. Identify interaction requirements.  
    2. Design system architecture.  
    3. Plan safety and trust mechanisms.  
- **Takeaways**:  
  - Safety is critical for HRI.  
  - Trust enables effective collaboration.  
  - System design requires careful integration.  
- **Learn with AI**:  
  - `hri_system_designer`: RI component that helps students design complete HRI systems.
