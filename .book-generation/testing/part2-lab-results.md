# Part 2 Lab Results Log – Physical Robotics Foundations (T150)

**Scope**: Execution results for all **Part 2** physical labs (Mechanical Structures, Sensors, Actuators, Power, Kinematics, Dynamics, Control).  
**Purpose**: Provide an evidence trail for lab feasibility, typical completion time, observed issues, and suggested fixes.

---

## How to Use This Log

- Each row represents one lab run by an **independent tester** (student, educator, or robotics practitioner who did not author the lab).  
- Multiple runs per lab are encouraged to capture variability in setups and experience levels.  
- Keep descriptions concrete and actionable; avoid personally identifying information.

> NOTE: As of 2025-12-01, this file is a **template** prepared by the book-generation pipeline; actual entries must be populated by independent testers as part of the Part 2 QA process.

## Initial Status (2025-12-01)

- Template created and committed for all Part 2 labs.  
- No independent lab runs logged yet; T150 remains **pending** until at least one full pass of all Part 2 labs is completed and documented here.  
- Recommended next step: recruit 2–3 external testers and schedule a full Part 2 lab run, using this log to capture completion times and issues.
