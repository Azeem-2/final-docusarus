## Research Question

How can robots learn behaviors by observing and imitating expert demonstrations, and what are the key approaches, challenges, and applications in robotics simulation?

---

## Key Research Areas

1. **Behavioral Cloning**: Learning policies directly from demonstration data
2. **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)**: Inferring reward functions from demonstrations
3. **Dataset Aggregation (DAgger)**: Iterative improvement with expert feedback
4. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Using simulated demonstrations for real-world deployment
5. **Multi-modal Demonstrations**: Combining vision, proprioception, and language
6. **Data Efficiency**: Learning from limited demonstrations
7. **Distribution Shift**: Handling differences between demonstration and deployment environments
