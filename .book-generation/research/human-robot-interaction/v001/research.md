## Key Concepts Identified

### Core Concepts
- **Human–Robot Interaction (HRI)**: Communication and collaboration between humans and robots
- **Modalities**: Speech, gestures, touch, vision
- **Safety**: Ensuring safe interaction
- **Trust**: Building human trust in robots
- **Adaptation**: Robots adapting to human preferences

### Techniques
- **Natural language processing**: Understanding human speech
- **Gesture recognition**: Recognizing human gestures
- **Touch interfaces**: Physical interaction
- **Vision-based interaction**: Understanding human actions
- **Multi-modal interaction**: Combining multiple modalities

### Workflows
- Human input → Perception → Understanding → Planning → Action → Feedback

## Research Notes

### HRI Fundamentals

**Interaction Modalities**:
- **Speech**: Natural language commands and responses
- **Gestures**: Hand and body gestures for communication
- **Touch**: Physical interaction and haptic feedback
- **Vision**: Understanding human actions and intentions

**Safety and Trust**:
- **Safety**: Ensuring physical and psychological safety
- **Trust**: Building human trust through reliable behavior
- **Transparency**: Making robot intentions clear

### Challenges

- **Communication**: Effective bidirectional communication
- **Safety**: Ensuring safe interaction
- **Trust**: Building and maintaining trust
- **Adaptation**: Adapting to individual human preferences

## Research Status

**Status**: Scaffold complete  
**Next Step**: Proceed to outliner-agent for chapter outline creation

**Note**: This research scaffold provides conceptual foundation. Full research with Tier 1/2 citations will be completed during the writing phase when specific claims need verification.
