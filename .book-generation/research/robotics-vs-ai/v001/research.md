## Research Question

How should we conceptually distinguish **robotics**, **artificial intelligence (AI)**, and **embodied intelligence** for an educational audience, and what are the key historical, technical, and philosophical threads that connect and separate these fields?

## Key Findings

1. **Robotics pre‑dates modern AI and is fundamentally about embodied machines interacting with the physical world**, while AI historically focused on abstract problem‑solving and symbol manipulation. – Confidence: High  
2. **Embodied intelligence** emphasizes that intelligence arises from the coupling of body, brain (control/computation), and environment; this view bridges robotics and AI and underpins modern embodied AI and physical AI narratives. – Confidence: High  
3. Modern practice blurs boundaries: many robotic systems embed machine learning and AI components, but not all robotics is AI, and not all AI is deployed in robots. – Confidence: High  
4. Historically, robotics drew from control theory, mechanics, and cybernetics, while AI grew from computer science, logic, and cognitive science; convergences began with behavior‑based robotics, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic robotics. – Confidence: High  
5. Educationally, treating robotics, AI, and embodied intelligence as **overlapping sets** (rather than synonyms) helps students reason about career paths, system architecture, and ethical questions. – Confidence: High  

## Sources

### Tier 1 Sources (Highly Authoritative)

- Classic robotics textbooks and embodied cognition literature (e.g., Siciliano et al., *Robotics*, Thrun et al., *Probabilistic Robotics*, and key embodied cognition papers).  
- Foundational AI texts (e.g., Russell & Norvig, *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*) and survey articles on embodied AI.  

### Tier 2 Sources (Reliable)

- Recent essays and reports on “physical AI” and “embodied intelligence” from reputable research labs, institutes, and think tanks.  

## Synthesis

The core distinction for the chapter is:

- **Robotics**: Focus on **physical systems** that sense, think, and act in the world.  
- **AI**: Focus on **algorithms and models** for perception, reasoning, and decision‑making, whether embodied or not.  
- **Embodied intelligence**: Focus on the **integration** of body, controller, learning, and environment, often emphasizing closed‑loop interaction, morphology, and co‑design.

The chapter should use Venn diagrams, historical timelines, and concrete examples (e.g., chess program vs. mobile robot vs. humanoid assistant) to anchor these ideas.
