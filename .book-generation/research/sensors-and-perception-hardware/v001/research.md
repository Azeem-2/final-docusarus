# Topic: Sensors & Perception Hardware for Robotics (P2-C2)

**Research Date**: 2025-12-01  
**Time Spent**: 0.5 hours (scaffold created; detailed sourcing to follow in dedicated research-agent pass)  
**Total Sources**: 0 (placeholder – to be populated)

## Research Question

What hardware building blocks underpin sensors and perception for mobile and manipulator robots, and how should we organize an educational chapter (P2-C2) that introduces these components in a way that connects cleanly to later perception, simulation, and project chapters?

## Key Areas to Cover (Scaffold)

1. Core sensing modalities: encoders, IMUs, force/torque sensors, proximity sensors, cameras, depth sensors, LiDAR.  
2. Signal paths: from analog phenomena to digital signals (sensing, conditioning, A/D conversion, interfaces).  
3. Mounting and field of view: how sensor placement, calibration, and field of view affect perception quality.  
4. Perception pipelines: how raw sensor data flows into state estimation, mapping, and higher-level perception.  
5. Practical constraints: noise, bandwidth, latency, dynamic range, environmental robustness, cost.  
6. Safety and reliability: redundancy, health monitoring, and failure modes for critical sensors.  

## Notes

- This file is a **scaffold** to start the P2-C2 pipeline; a full research-agent pass will be needed to populate Tier 1/Tier 2 sources and detailed findings.
