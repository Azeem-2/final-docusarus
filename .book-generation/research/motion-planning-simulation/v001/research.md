## Research Question

How do robots plan collision-free paths and trajectories in simulation, and what are the fundamental algorithms, trade-offs, and integration with control and perception?

---

## Key Research Areas

1. **Configuration Space (C-space)**: Representing robot states and obstacles
2. **Sampling-Based Planners**: RRT, PRM, and variants
3. **Optimization-Based Planning**: Trajectory optimization and gradient-based methods
4. **Dynamic Constraints**: Velocity, acceleration, and dynamics-aware planning
5. **Replanning and Real-Time Planning**: Handling dynamic environments
6. **Integration with Control**: Connecting planned trajectories to low-level controllers
7. **Simulation Advantages**: Fast collision checking, parallel planning, and validation

## Notes

- Focus on conceptual understanding and practical trade-offs
- Emphasize simulation-specific advantages (fast collision checking, parallelization)
- Connect to kinematics (P2-C5), dynamics (P2-C6), and control (P2-C7)
- Balance between algorithmic intuition and implementation considerations
