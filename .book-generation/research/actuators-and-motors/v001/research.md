# Topic: Actuators & Motors for Robotics (P2-C3)

**Research Date**: 2025-12-01  
**Time Spent**: 0.5 hours (scaffold created; detailed sourcing to follow in dedicated research-agent pass)  
**Total Sources**: 0 (placeholder – to be populated)

## Research Question

What are the main classes of actuators and motors used in modern robots, what trade-offs do they present for embodied intelligence, and how should an educational chapter (P2-C3) organize this material so it connects naturally to later kinematics, dynamics, control, and project chapters?

## Key Areas to Cover (Scaffold)

1. Core actuator types: brushed/brushless DC motors, servos, stepper motors, series elastic actuators, hydraulic and pneumatic actuators.  
2. Power transmission: gearboxes, belts, harmonic drives, cable/ tendon drives, and their effect on backdrivability and compliance.  
3. Sizing and selection: torque–speed curves, thermal limits, efficiency, and duty cycles.  
4. Sensing in actuators: encoders, current sensing, torque sensing, integrated smart actuators.  
5. Safety and reliability: failure modes, brakes, emergency stops, and protective design for high‑power actuation.  
6. Application patterns: how different robots (arms, mobile bases, humanoids, soft robots) choose actuator technologies.  

## Notes

- This file is a **scaffold** to start the P2-C3 pipeline; a full research-agent pass will be needed to populate Tier 1/Tier 2 sources and detailed findings.
