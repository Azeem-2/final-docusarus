## Research Question

What foundational reinforcement learning (RL) concepts, algorithms, and robotics-relevant examples are needed to introduce beginners to **RL for robot control in simulation**, while keeping math approachable and tying clearly to later advanced RL chapters?

## Key Areas to Cover (Scaffold)

1. **Core RL Concepts**
   - Agent, environment, state, action, reward, episode.  
   - Markov decision process (MDP) idea at an intuitive level.

2. **Reward Design**
   - Shaping vs sparse rewards.  
   - Common pitfalls (reward hacking, unintended behaviors).

3. **Value-Based and Policy-Based Methods (High Level)**
   - Q-learning / DQN as a simple value-based example.  
   - Policy gradient intuition (optimize parameters to improve behavior).  
   - Actor–critic concept without heavy math.

4. **RL in Robotics Simulation**
   - Why robotics often starts RL in simulation (sample efficiency, safety).  
   - Typical task examples: balancing, locomotion, reaching, navigation.

5. **Exploration and Stability**
   - ε-greedy, entropy bonuses (conceptual).  
   - Importance of safe exploration for physical systems (preview to sim-to-real and safety chapters).

6. **Libraries and Tooling (Conceptual)**
   - High-level note on common RL libraries and simulator integrations (no code details yet).

7. **Bridge to Advanced RL (P4-C4) and Sim-to-Real (P3-C7)**
   - How this basic chapter sets up later discussions on advanced algorithms and transfer.

## Notes

- This file is a **research-agent scaffold**; detailed citations, benchmark references, and library comparisons will be filled in during a deeper research pass.  
- The outliner-agent, chapter-structure-architect, and lesson-planner should use this as a conceptual map to keep the chapter **introductory yet robotics-focused**.
