# Topic: Power Systems & Batteries for Robotics (P2-C4)

**Research Date**: 2025-12-01  
**Time Spent**: 0.5 hours (scaffold created; detailed sourcing to follow in full research-agent pass)  
**Total Sources**: 0 (placeholder – to be populated)

## Research Question

How should we introduce power systems and batteries for mobile and stationary robots so that learners can size, select, and operate power hardware safely, and how should this chapter (P2-C4) connect to mechanics (P2-C1), sensing (P2-C2), actuation (P2-C3), and later control/simulation chapters?

## Key Areas to Cover (Scaffold)

1. **Energy & Power Basics** – Voltage, current, power, energy, efficiency; power budgets for typical robots.  
2. **Battery Technologies** – Common chemistries (Li-ion, LiFePO₄, NiMH, lead-acid), pros/cons, cycle life, energy density.  
3. **Power Electronics** – Battery management systems (BMS), DC/DC converters, motor drivers, protection circuits, wiring.  
4. **Charging & Runtime Estimation** – Charge current limits, CC/CV profiles, state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), runtime calculations.  
5. **Safety & Standards** – Overcurrent, over/under-voltage, thermal runaway, fusing, isolation, basic regulatory considerations.  
6. **Architectures & Examples** – Power system layouts for small mobile robots, arms on carts, and stationary cells; on-board vs off-board power.  

## Notes

- This file is a **scaffold**: it defines the conceptual scope and connections for P2-C4 but does not yet contain detailed Tier 1/Tier 2 references or quantitative examples.  
- A subsequent dedicated research-agent pass should populate authoritative sources (battery application notes, robotics power design guides, safety standards) before citation-heavy editing.
