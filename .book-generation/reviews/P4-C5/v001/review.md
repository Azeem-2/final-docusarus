## Review Summary

**Approval Status**: `ApprovedWithMinorRevisions`

**Quality Score**: 87/100

**Overall Assessment**: The draft provides a clear, practical introduction to trajectory optimization for robotics. Good coverage of optimization methods, cost functions, and constraint handling. Strong connections to P3-C5 (motion planning) and P4-C3 (control policies).

## Pass 1: Structural Review

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- All 10 sections from outline are present and well-organized.  
- Logical flow from introduction → path vs trajectory → cost functions → optimization methods → constraints → real-time → summary.  
- Good connections to P3-C5 (motion planning) and P4-C3 (control policies).  
- Summary section effectively integrates concepts.

---

## Pass 2: Content Quality

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- Clear explanation of path vs trajectory distinction.  
- Good coverage of cost functions (time, smoothness, energy).  
- Optimization methods (QP, nonlinear, collocation) well-explained.  
- Constraint handling appropriately emphasized.  
- Real-time optimization techniques provide practical guidance.

**Minor Suggestions**:
- Add concrete examples of trajectory optimization results.  
- Expand real-time optimization section with more implementation details.

## Pass 3: Citation Verification

**Status**: ⚠ DEFERRED

- Citations placeholder noted in draft metadata.  
- Full citation pass scheduled for later QA phase.  
- Should reference Ruckig, optimization papers when citations are added.

---

## Pass 4: Consistency Audit

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- Terminology consistent with P3-C5 (motion planning) and P2-C5/P2-C6 (kinematics/dynamics).  
- Voice and tone match Part 4 style.  
- Cross-references appropriate.

**Minor Suggestions**:
- Add glossary terms: "trajectory optimization", "path vs trajectory", "time-optimal", "direct collocation", "shooting method", "constraint handling".

---

## Pass 5: Factual Accuracy

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- Conceptual descriptions are accurate at the intended level.  
- Optimization method descriptions align with standard approaches.  
- No obvious factual errors detected.
