- ⚠️ **Missing elements**: Some citations lack author/year/URL
- ✅ Research sources properly referenced

**Citation Quality**:
- ✅ Sources are authoritative
- ✅ Sources are current
- ✅ Multiple sources for major claims

**Cross-Reference with Research**:
- ✅ Cited sources exist in research notes
- ⚠️ Some citations need to match research.md format

**Recommended Changes**: 7 citation improvements

## Pass 6: Factual Accuracy ⚠️

**Status**: NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Verification Against Research**:
- ✅ Current state claims match research
- ✅ Research trajectories align with research.md
- ⚠️ **Verification needed**: Future predictions (5/10/20 year) - verify these are research-based, not speculative
- ⚠️ **Verification needed**: Technology timelines - verify against research sources

**Cross-Reference Method**:
- ✅ Claims match research.md where applicable
- ⚠️ Future predictions need clear research basis

**Confidence Levels**:
- **High**: Current state and near-term (5-year) predictions
- **Medium**: Mid-term (10-year) predictions
- **Low**: Long-term (20-year) predictions (inherently speculative)

**Recommended Changes**: 5 factual verifications
