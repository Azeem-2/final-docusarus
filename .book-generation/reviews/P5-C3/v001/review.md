## Review Summary

**Approval Status**: `ApprovedWithMinorRevisions`

**Quality Score**: 87/100

**Overall Assessment**: The draft provides a clear, practical introduction to balance and stability for humanoid robots. Good coverage of balance metrics, control strategies, and disturbance rejection. Strong connections to P5-C1 (humanoid kinematics/dynamics) and P5-C2 (bipedal locomotion).

## Pass 1: Structural Review

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- All 10 sections from outline are present and well-organized.  
- Logical flow from introduction → metrics → capture point → margins → strategies → disturbance → implementation → summary.  
- Good connections to P5-C1 and P5-C2.  
- Summary section effectively integrates concepts.

---

## Pass 2: Content Quality

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- Clear explanation of balance metrics (ZMP, CoP, capture point).  
- Good coverage of balance control strategies (ankle, hip, step).  
- Disturbance rejection well-explained.  
- Implementation considerations appropriately emphasized.

**Minor Suggestions**:
- Add concrete examples of disturbance magnitudes and recovery times.  
- Expand multi-strategy coordination section.

## Pass 3: Citation Verification

**Status**: ⚠ DEFERRED

- Citations placeholder noted in draft metadata.  
- Full citation pass scheduled for later QA phase.  
- Should reference balance control papers, ZMP papers, capture point papers when citations are added.

---

## Pass 4: Consistency Audit

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- Terminology consistent with P5-C1 and P5-C2.  
- Voice and tone match Part 5 style.  
- Cross-references appropriate.

**Minor Suggestions**:
- Add glossary terms: "balance", "stability", "ZMP", "CoP", "capture point", "stability margin", "ankle strategy", "hip strategy", "step recovery".

## Pass 5: Factual Accuracy

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- Conceptual descriptions are accurate at the intended level.  
- Control strategy descriptions align with standard approaches.  
- No obvious factual errors detected.
