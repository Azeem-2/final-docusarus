## Review Summary

**Approval Status**: `ApprovedWithMinorRevisions`

**Quality Score**: 88/100

**Overall Assessment**: The draft provides a clear, practical introduction to Human–Robot Interaction for humanoid robots. Good coverage of interaction modalities, natural language, gestures, touch, vision, and multi-modal interaction. Strong connections to P5-C4 (manipulation) and forward reference to P5-C6 (safety). Excellent use of Firecrawl research on HRI safety and trust.
