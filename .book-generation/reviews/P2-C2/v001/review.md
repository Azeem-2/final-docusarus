# Editorial Review: P2-C2 Sensors & Perception Hardware (v001)

**Reviewer**: book-editor (initial automated pass)  
**Draft Version**: `.book-generation/drafts/P2-C2/v001/draft.md`  
**Review Date**: 2025-12-01  
**Review Passes**: Structural, Content, Consistency (citations and detailed factual checks deferred)

---

## Pass 1: Structural Analysis

- Introduction clearly motivates why sensing is fundamental to robotics and connects to Part 1.  
- Main body sections follow a logical progression: basics → proprioceptive → exteroceptive → mounting/FOV → interfaces/noise/latency → example stacks → safety.  
- Summary and bridge section prepares readers for later perception and control chapters.

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

---

## Pass 2: Content Quality (Partial)

- Voice is consistent with a balanced, introductory technical tone and matches other Part 2 material.  
- Paragraph structure is generally clear; some sections are intentionally left at an outline-like level for later expansion (e.g., labs, detailed examples).  
- Key concepts (range, resolution, noise, latency, FOV, redundancy) are introduced with intuitive explanations.

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL – Good foundation for a full chapter; additional examples, diagrams, and citations should be added in later passes.

---

## Pass 3–5: Citations, Consistency, Factual Accuracy

- Not executed in this initial pass. Citations are expected to come from the P2-C2 research file once it is fully populated.  
- Factual and safety-critical claims will need explicit verification during a dedicated QA/editorial phase.

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

---

## Approval Status

- **Current status**: `ApprovedWithMinorRevisions` as a working draft within the pipeline.  
- **Blocking issues**: None identified that prevent moving on to diagrams, manuscript integration, or later QA phases.
