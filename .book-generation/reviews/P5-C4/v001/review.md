## Review Summary

**Approval Status**: `ApprovedWithMinorRevisions`

**Quality Score**: 87/100

**Overall Assessment**: The draft provides a clear, practical introduction to manipulation and dexterity for humanoid robots. Good coverage of grasping strategies, hand kinematics, force control, and tool use. Strong connections to P5-C1 (humanoid kinematics) and forward reference to P5-C5 (HRI). Excellent use of MCP research (ManiSkill, MoveIt 2, DexHand).

## Pass 1: Structural Review

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- All 10 sections from outline are present and well-organized.  
- Logical flow from introduction → grasping → kinematics → force control → planning → in-hand → tool use → challenges → implementation → summary.  
- Good connections to P5-C1 and forward references to P5-C5.  
- Summary section effectively integrates concepts.

## Pass 2: Content Quality

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- Clear explanation of grasping strategies (power, precision, in-hand).  
- Good coverage of hand kinematics and force control.  
- Tactile sensing and grasp planning well-explained.  
- Tool use appropriately covered.

**Minor Suggestions**:
- Add concrete examples of grasp success rates.  
- Expand in-hand manipulation section with more detail.

## Pass 3: Citation Verification

**Status**: ⚠ DEFERRED

- Citations placeholder noted in draft metadata.  
- Full citation pass scheduled for later QA phase.  
- Should reference MCP research (ManiSkill, MoveIt 2, DexHand), manipulation papers when citations are added.

## Pass 4: Consistency Audit

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- Terminology consistent with P5-C1 (humanoid kinematics).  
- Voice and tone match Part 5 style.  
- Cross-references appropriate.

**Minor Suggestions**:
- Add glossary terms: "manipulation", "dexterity", "power grasp", "precision grasp", "in-hand manipulation", "hand kinematics", "tactile sensing".

## Pass 5: Factual Accuracy

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- Conceptual descriptions are accurate at the intended level.  
- Method descriptions align with standard approaches.  
- No obvious factual errors detected.
