## Pass 1: Structural Review

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- All 12 sections from outline are present and well-organized.  
- Logical flow from introduction → design → kinematics → dynamics → RL → validation → integration.  
- Excellent integration with Part 5 concepts.  
- Summary section effectively synthesizes all concepts.

## Pass 2: Content Quality

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- Clear explanation of 6-DOF leg design.  
- Good coverage of kinematics and dynamics.  
- Strong RL-based locomotion section.  
- Appropriate validation and testing guidance.

**Minor Suggestions**:
- Add more specific code examples for kinematics and dynamics.
- Expand RL reward function design with more examples.
- Add more detailed validation metrics.

## Pass 4: Consistency Audit

**Status**: ✓ PASS

- Terminology consistent with Part 5 chapters.  
- Voice and tone match Part 6 project style.  
- Cross-references appropriate.

**Minor Suggestions**:
- Add glossary terms: "humanoid leg", "6-DOF serial mechanism", "oblique joint axes".
