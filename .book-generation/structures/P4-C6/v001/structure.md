## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: policy distillation, teacher-student framework, knowledge distillation, behavioral cloning distillation, feature matching, logit matching, privileged information, progressive distillation.  
- **Prerequisites**: Control policies (P4-C3), RL advanced (P4-C4), sim-to-real transfer (P3-C7).  
- **Math depth**: Minimal; focus on methods, workflows, and practical considerations.

Target: **3 lessons** emphasizing practical distillation methods and deployment over deep theoretical derivations.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why policy distillation; compression for deployment.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Distillation methods, teacher-student framework.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Privileged information, progressive distillation.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Practical deployment, evaluation, integration with RL.
