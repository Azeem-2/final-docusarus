## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: multi-modal models, vision-language models (VLMs), cross-modal fusion, visual question answering, object grounding, language-to-action, scene understanding.  
- **Prerequisites**: Understanding of vision models (P4-C1), basic neural networks, transformer architecture.  
- **Math depth**: Minimal; focus on concepts, architectures, and applications.

Target: **3 lessons** emphasizing practical applications and integration over deep theoretical derivations.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why multi-modal models matter for robotics; vision + language understanding.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: VLM architectures, how they work, key models (LLaVA, GPT-Vision, Gemini).  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Robotics use cases (VQA, grounding, language-to-action).  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Practical deployment, fine-tuning, integration with robot control.
