## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: Humanoid leg design, 6-DOF serial mechanism, oblique joint axes, leg kinematics, leg dynamics, RL-based locomotion for legs.  
- **Prerequisites**: Part 5 (Humanoid Kinematics & Dynamics, Bipedal Locomotion, Balance & Stability).  
- **Math depth**: Moderate; kinematics and dynamics calculations, RL training.

Target: **4 lessons** covering design, kinematics/dynamics, RL control, and validation.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why humanoid legs, design principles.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Kinematics, dynamics, modeling.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: RL-based control, walking, balance.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Validation, sim-to-real, full humanoid integration.

## Lesson Breakdown

1. **Lesson 1 – Humanoid Leg Design and Modeling**  
2. **Lesson 2 – Kinematics and Dynamics Implementation**  
3. **Lesson 3 – RL-Based Locomotion Control**  
4. **Lesson 4 – Validation and Integration**  

Each lesson follows the standard 6-part pattern (Hook, Theory, Walkthrough, Challenge, Takeaways, Learn with AI).
