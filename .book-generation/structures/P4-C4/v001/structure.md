## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: actor-critic methods, PPO, SAC, TD3, on-policy vs off-policy, continuous action spaces, sample efficiency, stability techniques.  
- **Prerequisites**: RL basics (P3-C3), control policies (P4-C3).  
- **Math depth**: Moderate; focus on algorithms and practical considerations.

Target: **3 lessons** emphasizing practical algorithm selection and training over deep theoretical derivations.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why advanced RL algorithms; limitations of basic methods.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Actor-critic methods, PPO, SAC, TD3.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Algorithm selection, training workflows.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Sample efficiency, stability, deployment.

## Lesson Breakdown

1. **Lesson 1 – Actor-Critic Methods and PPO**  
2. **Lesson 2 – Off-Policy Methods: SAC and TD3**  
3. **Lesson 3 – Sample Efficiency, Stability, and Advanced Techniques**  

Each lesson follows the standard 6-part pattern (Hook, Theory, Walkthrough, Challenge, Takeaways, Learn with AI).
