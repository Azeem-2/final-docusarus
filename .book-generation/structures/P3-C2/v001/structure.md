## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: scene geometry, collision shapes, physical materials, contact parameters, lighting & textures for perception, domain randomization basics.  
- **Prerequisites**: Part 2 mechanical structures and sensors (P2-C1, P2-C2); basic physics intuition.  
- **Math depth**: qualitative; a few simple equations or relationships for units and basic physical parameters only.

Target: **3 lessons** focusing on practical environment design for robotics simulation and sim-to-real readiness.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why environment fidelity matters for robot behavior; examples from simple vs realistic scenes.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Geometry, materials, collision models, sensor visibility, and dynamics parameters.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Building and modifying environments for typical robotics tasks in simulation.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Connecting environment design to RL training (P3-C3) and sim-to-real transfer (P3-C7).
