## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: HRI, interaction modalities (speech, gestures, touch, vision), natural language, gesture recognition, haptic feedback, multi-modal interaction, safety, trust, adaptation.  
- **Prerequisites**: Manipulation & dexterity (P5-C4), language-to-action (P4-C7).  
- **Math depth**: Minimal; focus on interaction design and implementation.

Target: **3 lessons** emphasizing practical HRI design and implementation over deep theoretical derivations.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why HRI; interaction modalities.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Speech, gestures, touch, vision.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Multi-modal interaction, safety, trust.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: System design, implementation, evaluation.

## Lesson Breakdown

1. **Lesson 1 – Interaction Modalities: Speech and Gestures**  
2. **Lesson 2 – Touch, Vision, and Multi-Modal Interaction**  
3. **Lesson 3 – Safety, Trust, and HRI System Implementation**  

Each lesson follows the standard 6-part pattern (Hook, Theory, Walkthrough, Challenge, Takeaways, Learn with AI).
