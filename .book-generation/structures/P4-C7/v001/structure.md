## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: language-to-action, language-conditioned policies, visual grounding, action grounding, end-to-end learning, modular approaches, ambiguity handling, context understanding.  
- **Prerequisites**: Multi-modal models (P4-C2), control policies (P4-C3), RL advanced (P4-C4).  
- **Math depth**: Minimal; focus on architectures, workflows, and integration.

Target: **3 lessons** emphasizing practical system design and integration over deep theoretical derivations.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why language-to-action; natural human-robot interaction.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Language-conditioned policies, grounding mechanisms.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: End-to-end vs modular approaches, challenges.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Integration with robot systems, real-world deployment.
