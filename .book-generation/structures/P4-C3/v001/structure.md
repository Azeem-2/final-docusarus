## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: learned control policies, neural network controllers, policy architectures (MLP, CNN, Transformer, Diffusion), training methods (imitation, RL, offline RL), vision-based control, multi-modal policies, deployment considerations.  
- **Prerequisites**: Understanding of control systems (P2-C7), RL basics (P3-C3), imitation learning (P3-C4), vision models (P4-C1), multi-modal models (P4-C2).  
- **Math depth**: Minimal; focus on architectures, training, and deployment.

Target: **3 lessons** emphasizing practical policy design and deployment over deep theoretical derivations.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why learned control policies; traditional vs learned control.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Policy architectures, training methods, vision-based control.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Multi-modal policies, deployment workflows.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Safety, robustness, integration with perception and planning.

## Lesson Breakdown

1. **Lesson 1 – Policy Architectures and Training Methods**  
2. **Lesson 2 – Vision-Based and Multi-modal Control Policies**  
3. **Lesson 3 – Deployment, Safety, and Integration**  

Each lesson follows the standard 6-part pattern (Hook, Theory, Walkthrough, Challenge, Takeaways, Learn with AI).
