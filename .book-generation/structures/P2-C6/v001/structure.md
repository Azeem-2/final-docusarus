## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: inertia, mass matrix (conceptual), coriolis/centrifugal effects, gravity terms, torque balance, energy and momentum viewpoints.  
- **Prerequisites**: P2‑C5 kinematics (frames, FK), basic Newtonian mechanics.  
- **Math depth**: qualitative and diagram‑heavy; full equations and derivations deferred to later advanced chapters.  

Target: **3 lessons**, focusing on intuition for forces, torques, and motion responses.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: How pushing/pulling on a robot changes motion; inertia vs mass.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Free‑body diagrams, simple torque balances, gravity effects.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Reasoning about dynamic behaviors of arms and mobile bases.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: How dynamics feed into control design and simulation models.
