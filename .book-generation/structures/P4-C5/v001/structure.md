## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: trajectory optimization, path vs trajectory, cost functions, QP, nonlinear optimization, direct collocation, shooting methods, constraint handling, real-time optimization.  
- **Prerequisites**: Kinematics (P2-C5), dynamics (P2-C6), motion planning (P3-C5).  
- **Math depth**: Moderate; optimization concepts without deep derivations.

Target: **3 lessons** emphasizing practical optimization methods and applications over deep theoretical derivations.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why trajectory optimization; path vs trajectory.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Cost functions, optimization methods (QP, nonlinear, collocation).  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Constraint handling, real-time optimization.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Integration with motion planning and control.
