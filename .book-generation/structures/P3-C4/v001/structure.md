## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: behavioral cloning, inverse reinforcement learning (conceptual), dataset aggregation, distribution shift, demonstration data, expert policies.  
- **Prerequisites**: P3-C3 (RL basics), basic understanding of policies and rewards.  
- **Math depth**: mostly conceptual; IRL and DAgger described intuitively without formal derivations.

Target: **3 lessons** focusing on practical imitation learning approaches and their role in robotics simulation.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why learning from demonstrations is useful; examples of expert demonstrations.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Behavioral cloning, IRL basics, dataset aggregation.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Using demonstrations in simulation, multi-modal data, data efficiency.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Connecting imitation learning to RL and sim-to-real transfer.

## Lesson Breakdown

1. **Lesson 1 – Behavioral Cloning and Direct Policy Learning**  
2. **Lesson 2 – Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Dataset Aggregation (Conceptual)**  
3. **Lesson 3 – Multi-modal Demonstrations, Data Efficiency, and Integration**

Each lesson follows the standard 6-part pattern (Hook, Theory, Walkthrough, Challenge, Takeaways, Learn with AI).
