## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: reality gap, domain randomization strategies, system identification, sim-to-sim validation, teacher-student distillation, fine-tuning workflows, safety mechanisms.  
- **Prerequisites**: Understanding of physics engines (P3-C1), environment modeling (P3-C2), RL basics (P3-C3), imitation learning (P3-C4), motion planning (P3-C5), simulation toolchains (P3-C6).  
- **Math depth**: Minimal; focus on practical workflows, techniques, and safety considerations.

Target: **3 lessons** emphasizing practical workflows and safety over deep theoretical derivations.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why sim-to-real transfer is challenging; reality gap concept.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Domain randomization, system identification, sim-to-sim validation.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Teacher-student distillation, fine-tuning workflows, practical deployment.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Complete workflows, safety mechanisms, connection to Parts 1-3.
