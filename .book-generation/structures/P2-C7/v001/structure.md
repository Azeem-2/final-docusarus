## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: feedback loops, reference, error, P/PI/PID control (conceptual), stability intuition, tuning trade-offs.  
- **Prerequisites**: P2‑C5 (kinematics), P2‑C6 (dynamics), basic algebra and graph reading.  
- **Math depth**: block diagrams and time‑domain intuition; transfer functions and frequency‑domain tools deferred.  

Target: **3 lessons** focusing on feedback intuition and practical tuning stories.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why feedback is needed; open‑loop vs closed‑loop behavior.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Error, gain, proportional/integral/derivative actions.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Examples on joint control and mobile robot velocity/heading.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: How control interacts with kinematics/dynamics and power limits.

## Lesson Breakdown

1. **Lesson 1 – Feedback and the Control Loop**  
2. **Lesson 2 – PID Control for Robot Joints and Bases**  
3. **Lesson 3 – Tuning, Limits, and Robustness (Conceptual)**  

Each lesson will follow the standard 6-part pattern (Hook, Theory, Walkthrough, Challenge, Takeaways, Learn with AI).
