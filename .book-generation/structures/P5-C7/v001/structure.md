## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why case studies; analysis framework.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Individual robot analysis (Optimus, Figure 01, Atlas).  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Comparative analysis (design, capabilities, applications).  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Lessons learned, future directions.
