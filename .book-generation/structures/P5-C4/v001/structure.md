## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: manipulation, dexterity, grasping (power, precision), in-hand manipulation, hand kinematics, force control, tactile sensing, grasp planning, tool use.  
- **Prerequisites**: Humanoid kinematics & dynamics (P5-C1), general kinematics (P2-C5), control (P2-C7).  
- **Math depth**: Moderate; hand kinematics and force control without deep derivations.

Target: **3 lessons** emphasizing practical manipulation and dexterity over deep theoretical derivations.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why manipulation; grasping strategies.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Hand kinematics, force control, tactile sensing.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Grasp planning, in-hand manipulation, tool use.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Challenges, implementation, sim-to-real.

## Lesson Breakdown

1. **Lesson 1 – Grasping Strategies and Hand Kinematics**  
2. **Lesson 2 – Force Control, Tactile Sensing, and Grasp Planning**  
3. **Lesson 3 – In-Hand Manipulation, Tool Use, and Implementation**  

Each lesson follows the standard 6-part pattern (Hook, Theory, Walkthrough, Challenge, Takeaways, Learn with AI).
