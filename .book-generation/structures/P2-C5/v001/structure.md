## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: joint space vs task space, forward/inverse kinematics, DH parameters (conceptual), Jacobians (conceptual), singularities.  
- **Prerequisites**: Part 1 foundations, Part 2 mechanical structures, basic linear algebra.  
- **Math depth**: qualitative with light notation; rigorous derivations deferred to later parts and appendices.  

Target: **3 lessons** with strong visual intuition and minimal symbolic overload.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Moving from joint angles to end-effector motion; everyday analogies.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Coordinate frames, forward kinematics, workspace.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Simple 2D/3D arms, reasoning about reachability and constraints.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: How kinematics feeds motion planning and control in later chapters.

## Lesson Breakdown

1. **Lesson 1 – Frames, Joints, and Workspace**  
2. **Lesson 2 – Forward Kinematics for Simple Arms**  
3. **Lesson 3 – Inverse Kinematics, Redundancy, and Singularities (Conceptual)**  

Each lesson will follow the standard 6-part pattern (Hook, Theory, Walkthrough, Challenge, Takeaways, Learn with AI).
