## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: balance, stability, ZMP, CoP, capture point, stability margins, ankle strategy, hip strategy, step recovery, disturbance rejection.  
- **Prerequisites**: Humanoid kinematics & dynamics (P5-C1), bipedal locomotion (P5-C2), dynamics (P2-C6), control (P2-C7).  
- **Math depth**: Moderate; balance metrics and control strategies without deep derivations.

Target: **3 lessons** emphasizing practical balance control and recovery strategies over deep theoretical derivations.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why balance matters; balance metrics.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: ZMP, CoP, capture point, stability margins.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Balance control strategies (ankle, hip, step).  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Disturbance rejection, implementation.
