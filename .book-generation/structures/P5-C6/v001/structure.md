## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: safety systems, collision avoidance, force limits, emergency stops, fail-safe design, safety monitoring, fault detection, safety standards, regulations.  
- **Prerequisites**: All Part 5 chapters (locomotion, balance, manipulation, HRI).  
- **Math depth**: Minimal; focus on safety principles and implementation.

Target: **3 lessons** emphasizing practical safety systems and best practices over deep theoretical derivations.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why safety; safety principles.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Collision avoidance, force limits, emergency stops.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Safety monitoring, fault detection, standards.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: System architecture, best practices, compliance.
