## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: configuration space, sampling-based planning (RRT, PRM), trajectory optimization, collision checking, dynamic constraints, replanning.  
- **Prerequisites**: P2-C5 (kinematics), P2-C6 (dynamics), P2-C7 (control), basic geometry intuition.  
- **Math depth**: conceptual; algorithms described qualitatively with simple examples.

Target: **3 lessons** focusing on practical motion planning approaches and simulation advantages.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why planning is needed; examples of collision-free path planning.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Configuration space, sampling-based methods, optimization-based planning.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Real-time planning, dynamic constraints, integration with control.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: How simulation enables fast planning and validation.
