## Concept Density & Lesson Count

- **New concepts**: simulation toolchains vs physics engines, platform ecosystems (Isaac Sim, Webots, Gazebo), workflows, ROS2 integration, GPU acceleration, RL training pipelines, platform selection criteria.  
- **Prerequisites**: Understanding of physics engines (P3-C1), environment modeling (P3-C2), basic RL concepts (P3-C3).  
- **Math depth**: Minimal; focus on practical workflows, tooling, and integration patterns.

Target: **3 lessons** emphasizing practical workflows and platform selection over deep technical implementation.

## Pedagogical Progression (4 Layers)

1. **Layer 1 – Intuition**: Why toolchains matter beyond physics engines; platform ecosystems and their roles.  
2. **Layer 2 – Concepts**: Workflows, integration patterns, GPU acceleration, RL training pipelines.  
3. **Layer 3 – Application**: Hands-on workflows in Isaac Sim, Webots, and Gazebo.  
4. **Layer 4 – Integration**: Platform selection criteria, multi-platform validation, connection to sim-to-real (P3-C7).

## Lesson Breakdown

1. **Lesson 1 – Simulation Toolchains Overview and Platform Comparison**  
2. **Lesson 2 – Isaac Sim: Workflows, Integration, and RL Support**  
3. **Lesson 3 – Webots and Gazebo: Alternative Workflows and Platform Selection**  

Each lesson follows the standard 6-part pattern (Hook, Theory, Walkthrough, Challenge, Takeaways, Learn with AI).
