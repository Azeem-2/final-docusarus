## Introduction – Why Sensors Matter

Every robot you will meet in this book—arms, mobile robots, humanoids, factory cells—shares one fundamental limitation: **it cannot act intelligently without sensing**. Motors can move joints, but without measurements a robot has no idea where it is, what it is touching, or what lies ahead. A controller with perfect math but poor sensing will still crash into obstacles, miss targets, and behave unpredictably.

Sensors and perception hardware are the robot’s **eyes, ears, and inner sense of self**. They turn continuous physical quantities—angles, distances, forces, light levels—into digital signals that software can interpret. In this chapter you will learn how those measurements are generated, what trade‑offs designers face when choosing sensors, and how different sensing “stacks” support different robot bodies.

You will build on concepts from Part 1 (Physical AI and embodied intelligence) and from the previous chapter on mechanical structures. There you saw how bodies and mechanisms shape what a robot can do. Here you will see how sensing shapes what a robot can **know** about its body and environment, and how that knowledge feeds later perception and control chapters.

## Sensing Basics – From Physical World to Signals

At a high level, most sensors follow the same path:

1. A **physical quantity** (angle, acceleration, light, distance, pressure) affects a material or circuit.  
2. That effect is turned into an **electrical signal** (voltage, current, resistance, capacitance).  
3. Electronics **condition** the signal (filtering, amplification).  
4. An **analog‑to‑digital converter (ADC)** samples the signal and produces numbers.  
5. A controller reads those numbers over a **bus or interface** and uses them in algorithms.  

From the robot’s point of view, only the final numbers are visible—but good designers keep the whole chain in mind. Every step introduces limits:

- **Range**: the minimum and maximum values that can be measured.  
- **Resolution**: the smallest change that can be distinguished.  
- **Sampling rate**: how often the signal is measured.  
- **Noise and drift**: random and systematic errors.  
- **Latency**: delay between the real event and the reported value.  

Throughout this chapter, you will see how these properties appear in practical sensors and why they matter for stability, accuracy, and safety.

## Proprioceptive Sensors – Knowing the Robot Itself

Proprioceptive sensors give the robot an internal sense of its own configuration and motion.

### Encoders

**Encoders** measure joint or wheel rotation. Common variants include:

- **Incremental encoders**: report changes in angle as pulses; the controller counts steps.  
- **Absolute encoders**: report the actual angle within a full revolution.  

For robot arms and mobile bases, encoders are the primary way to track where joints and wheels have moved. Their resolution and accuracy set hard limits on how precisely the robot can control position and velocity.

### IMUs

An **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** typically combines accelerometers and gyroscopes (and sometimes magnetometers). IMUs estimate:

- Orientation of the body.  
- Angular velocity.  
- Linear acceleration.  

Humanoids, legged robots, and drones rely on IMUs for balance and stabilization. However, IMU readings drift over time and must be fused with other measurements.

### Force/Torque Sensors

**Force/torque (F/T) sensors** measure interaction forces at joints or wrists. They are essential when:

- A robot must apply a gentle, controlled force (e.g., polishing, assembly).  
- A manipulator needs to feel when it contacts an object or the environment.  

Using these sensors, the controller can react to contact, adjust grip, and maintain safe interaction with humans.

> **🔧 Practical Tip:** When you tune a controller or estimator, always ask: *What proprioceptive sensors are available and how trustworthy are they?* This determines how aggressive you can be with control gains and how you design safety limits.

## Exteroceptive Sensors – Knowing the Environment

Exteroceptive sensors measure the world outside the robot’s body.

### Cameras and Depth Sensors

**Cameras** capture images; when paired with computer vision algorithms, they support:

- Object detection and recognition.  
- Pose estimation.  
- Visual servoing and navigation.  

**Depth sensors** (structured light, time‑of‑flight, stereo) provide distance information. They help robots:

- Build 3D maps.  
- Avoid obstacles.  
- Plan grasps and placements.

### LiDAR and Proximity Sensors

**LiDAR** (Light Detection and Ranging) scans the environment with laser beams to produce precise distance measurements. Mobile robots use LiDAR for:

- 2D/3D mapping.  
- Localization.  
- Obstacle avoidance in warehouses and factories.  

**Proximity sensors** (infrared, ultrasonic, simple bump switches) give basic information about nearby obstacles, often as low‑cost safety layers.

### Tactile and Contact Sensors

Tactile sensors—pressure pads, capacitive skins, or arrays embedded in hands—allow:

- Sensing of contact location and distribution.  
- Detection of slip and grip quality.  

These are especially important in human‑robot interaction and delicate manipulation.

> **💡 Key Insight:** Proprioception tells the robot *what it is doing*. Exteroception tells it *what the world is doing in response*.

## Mounting, Field of View, and Calibration

Choosing a sensor is only half the story; **where and how** you mount it is just as important.

- **Field of View (FOV)**: Cameras and LiDAR must be oriented so they see the relevant workspace without blind spots.  
- **Baseline and placement**: Stereo pairs and range sensors depend on geometry; misplacement or flexing structures introduce calibration errors.  
- **Vibration and isolation**: IMUs mounted on flexible or vibrating structures may see more noise than the robot body actually experiences.  

Calibration procedures—aligning sensor frames with robot frames—ensure that measurements are interpreted correctly in kinematics and mapping. Poor calibration leads to:

- Misaligned maps and models.  
- Inaccurate end‑effector poses.  
- Controllers that “think” they are safe when they are not.

## Interfaces, Noise, and Latency (Conceptual View)

Different sensors connect to controllers through different **interfaces** (I2C, SPI, CAN, Ethernet, fieldbuses). Without going deep into protocol details, you should understand that:

- Some interfaces provide **higher bandwidth** for large data streams (e.g., cameras, LiDAR).  
- Some provide **lower latency** and real‑time guarantees for control loops.  
- Shared buses can introduce **contention** and variable delays if overloaded.  

Noise and latency interact with control design:

- High noise may require filtering, which adds delay.  
- Too much delay can destabilize feedback controllers.  

These topics are explored more formally in later control and perception chapters; here you need only the intuition that hardware choices constrain what algorithms can do.

## Example Sensor Stacks for Common Robots

To make this concrete, consider three simplified “sensor stacks”:

- **Industrial arm**: joint encoders, sometimes joint torque sensors, one or more fixed cameras or 3D sensors in the cell, safety scanners or light curtains.  
- **Warehouse mobile robot**: wheel encoders, IMU, 2D LiDAR or depth cameras for navigation, bump sensors for last‑resort safety.  
- **Small humanoid**: joint encoders, IMU, cameras in the head, sometimes foot pressure sensors or tactile pads.  

Each stack reflects design trade‑offs:

- Arms operate in relatively constrained cells and can rely on precise proprioception plus a few well‑placed cameras.  
- Mobile robots must interpret cluttered, changing environments and so rely more heavily on exteroceptive sensing.  
- Humanoids demand rich proprioception and exteroception to balance and interact safely with humans.  

These examples set up the labs and projects you will see later in Parts 3, 5, and 6.

## Safety, Redundancy, and Health Monitoring

Sensing is directly tied to **safety**. If a robot does not correctly perceive a human or obstacle, it can cause harm. Safety‑aware sensor design includes:

- Redundant sensors for critical functions (e.g., two independent ways to detect stopping conditions).  
- Periodic self‑tests and plausibility checks (e.g., speed vs measured position).  
- Conservative fallbacks when data quality drops (e.g., reduced speed, safe stop).  

In later safety‑focused chapters you will see how these ideas are encoded into standards and formal requirements. Here, the key message is simple: **no safety story is complete without a sensing story**.

## Summary and Bridge to Perception Chapters

In this chapter you learned:

- How physical quantities become digital data through sensors and interfaces.  
- The difference between proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors and why both matter.  
- How mounting, field of view, noise, and latency affect what a robot can know.  
- Why sensor stacks differ across arms, mobile robots, and humanoids.  
- How sensing underpins safety, reliability, and future perception algorithms.  

The next chapters in Part 2 will focus on actuators, kinematics, and dynamics. Later, in Parts 3 and 4, you will see how the raw data from these sensors flows into **mapping**, **state estimation**, and **AI‑based perception**. You should now be able to read those chapters with a clear mental model of where the numbers come from and what hardware is hiding behind each symbol.
