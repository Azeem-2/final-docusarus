## How to use Part 1

Part 1 gives you a fast but solid foundation in **embodied intelligence**: systems where AI is not just predicting numbers on a screen but sensing, thinking, and acting in the physical world. These first five chapters are designed to be readable in order, but you can also treat them as a reference when you reach later, more technical parts of the book.

You should plan to **read Part 1 fully at least once**, then come back to specific chapters when you meet the same ideas again in later parts (physical robotics, simulation, AI, humanoids, and projects). The goal here is not to master every equation, but to build the mental map that makes the rest of the book feel familiar instead of overwhelming.

## What you will learn in each chapter

- **Chapter 1 – What is Physical AI (P1‑C1)**  
  Builds your intuition for “physical AI” as a unification of robotics, simulation, and modern machine learning. You will see why embodied systems are different from pure software, how dual‑domain thinking (physical + simulation) works, and how the rest of the book is organized around that idea.

- **Chapter 2 – Robotics vs AI vs Embodied Intelligence (P1‑C2)**  
  Clarifies the relationship between classical robotics, modern AI, and the broader concept of embodied intelligence. By the end, you should be able to explain where control theory, planning, learning, and perception fit together in both physical and simulated settings.

- **Chapter 3 – Evolution of Humanoid Robotics (P1‑C3)**  
  Traces the historical arc from early mechanical “automatons” to today’s humanoid platforms. You will learn how hardware, control, and AI capabilities have co‑evolved, and how simulators and digital twins now shape humanoid development before any hardware is turned on.

- **Chapter 4 – Role of Simulation in Robotics (P1‑C4)**  
  Explains why nearly every serious robotics workflow now depends on simulation: for design, debugging, data generation, and safety. This chapter introduces core ideas like physics engines, the “reality gap,” and sim‑to‑real transfer that you will study in depth in Parts 3 and 6.

- **Chapter 5 – Introduction to Digital Twins (P1‑C5)**  
  Introduces digital twins as “living” simulations connected to real robots, cells, and factories. You will learn to distinguish static simulations from twins, understand basic twin architectures, and see how twins support monitoring, optimization, and decision‑making in real deployments.

## How Part 1 connects to the rest of the book

- **Parts 2–3 (Physical + Simulation Foundations)** build directly on the mental models from Chapters 2–4. When you study kinematics, dynamics, and physics engines, you can return to Part 1 to remind yourself *why* these tools matter.
- **Part 4 (AI for Robotics)** assumes you understand the basic differences between abstract AI models and embodied intelligence from Chapters 1–2.
- **Part 5 (Humanoid Robotics)** uses the historical and conceptual lens from Chapter 3 to frame modern humanoid design.
- **Part 6 (Integrated Projects)** expects you to think in dual‑domain terms—physical lab plus simulation and/or digital twin—as introduced in Chapters 4–5.
- **Part 7 (Industry and Research Pathways)** revisits digital twins, simulation, and embodied intelligence at professional and research scale, using the vocabulary you first encounter here.

As you read, keep asking three questions:

1. **Where is the physical system in this story?**  
2. **Where is the simulated or digital representation?**  
3. **How do they interact to make the system safer, smarter, or easier to build?**  

If you can answer those three questions for each chapter in Part 1, you will be well prepared for everything that follows.
