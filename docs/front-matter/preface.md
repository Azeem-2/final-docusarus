# Preface

**Why This Book Exists**

Robotics is experiencing a renaissance. Humanoid robots are moving from research labs to factory floors. AI systems are learning to manipulate objects through trial and error in virtual worlds before touching physical hardware. Simulation platforms enable training policies that transfer seamlessly to real robots. This convergence of physical robotics, simulation, and artificial intelligence represents a fundamental shift in how we build intelligent systems.

Yet, despite this progress, a critical gap remains in robotics education. Most textbooks treat physical robotics and simulation as separate domains. Students learn about sensors and actuators in one course, then reinforcement learning in another, without understanding how these pieces fit together. This fragmentation creates knowledge silos that hinder real-world deployment.

**This book bridges that gap.**

We present a unified approach that treats physical robotics and simulation as complementary partners, not competitors. Every concept is explained through both physical and simulation lenses. You'll learn how to train policies in simulation and deploy them to physical robots. You'll understand the reality gap—the discrepancies between virtual and real worlds—and how to bridge it systematically.

**Who This Book Is For**

This book serves multiple audiences:

- **University Students**: Computer science, engineering, and robotics students seeking a comprehensive foundation in modern robotics
- **AI Engineers**: Practitioners familiar with machine learning who want to understand embodied intelligence
- **Robotics Beginners**: Those new to robotics who need a structured path from fundamentals to advanced topics
- **Simulation Practitioners**: Developers working with physics engines who want to understand physical deployment
- **Industry Professionals**: Engineers building real-world robotics systems who need practical guidance
- **Educators**: Instructors teaching robotics courses who need structured curriculum materials

**What Makes This Book Different**

**Dual-Domain Integration**: Every chapter covers both physical and simulation perspectives. You'll understand how concepts translate between virtual and real worlds.

**Modern Approach**: We focus on contemporary methods—reinforcement learning, foundation models, sim-to-real transfer—that represent the state of the art in 2025.

**Practical Focus**: Each chapter includes hands-on labs for both simulation and physical hardware. You'll build real projects, not just read about theory.

**Safety First**: Physical robotics involves real risks. We emphasize safety protocols, hazard identification, and responsible development throughout.

**Ethical Considerations**: As robots become more capable, ethical questions become more important. We address responsible AI, human agency, and safety throughout.

**How to Use This Book**

This book is designed for sequential reading, but chapters can also serve as reference material:

- **Part 1** establishes foundational concepts. Read this first.
- **Parts 2-4** cover core technical content. Read sequentially for best understanding.
- **Part 5** focuses on humanoid robotics. Requires Parts 2-4 as prerequisites.
- **Part 6** presents integrated projects. Apply knowledge from earlier parts.
- **Part 7** explores professional pathways and future directions.

Each chapter includes:
- **Learning Objectives**: What you'll be able to do after reading
- **Key Terms**: Essential vocabulary defined
- **Physical Explanation**: Hardware and real-world perspective
- **Simulation Explanation**: Virtual environment perspective
- **Integrated Understanding**: How physical and simulation connect
- **Examples**: Worked examples in both domains
- **Labs**: Hands-on exercises
- **Review Questions**: Self-assessment
