## User Request

Run P4-C7 (Language-to-Action Systems) in parallel using correct MCP servers and correct flow.

## Work Completed

### P4-C7 (Language-to-Action Systems) - Complete 6-Agent Pipeline ✓

**Phase 1: Research-Agent** ✓
- Created research scaffold using MCP Context7
- Fetched documentation from `/octo-models/octo` (Octo generalist robotic policies with language commands)
- Identified key concepts: language-to-action, language-conditioned policies, visual/action grounding, end-to-end vs modular approaches

**Phase 2: Outliner-Agent** ✓
- Created 10-section chapter outline

**Phase 3: Chapter-Structure-Architect** ✓
- Created structural blueprint with 3 lessons

**Phase 4: Lesson-Planner** ✓
- Created 3 detailed lesson blueprints

**Phase 5: Writer-Agent** ✓
- Created ~1,700-word draft covering: language-to-action systems, language-conditioned policies, visual/action grounding, end-to-end vs modular approaches, challenges (ambiguity, context, generalization), integration

**Phase 6: Book-Editor** ✓
- Created review: `ApprovedWithMinorRevisions` (88/100)

**Phase 7: Diagrams + Manuscript Copy** ✓
- Created 4 Mermaid diagrams
- Created manuscript chapter

### Task Status Updated

Updated `specs/1-robotics-book-spec/tasks.md`:
- **T169** now marked **complete**: P4-C7 has complete 6-agent pipeline

## Key Achievements

- **MCP Integration**: Successfully used Context7 MCP server to fetch documentation from Octo
- **Correct Flow**: Followed mandatory 6-agent sequential pipeline exactly as specified
- **Part 4 Completion**: P4-C7 completes Part 4's AI for Robotics theme, integrating all previous Part 4 chapters
- **Integration**: Effectively integrates with P4-C2 (multi-modal), P4-C3 (control policies), P4-C4 (RL advanced)

## Progress Summary

Part 4 now has **6 of 7 chapters** fully pipelined:
- P4-C1: Vision Models (complete from Pilot)
- P4-C2: Multi-modal Models (complete)
- P4-C3: Control Policies (complete)
- P4-C4: Reinforcement Learning Advanced (complete)
- P4-C5: Trajectory Optimization (complete)
- P4-C7: Language-to-Action Systems (complete)

Remaining Part 4 chapter:
- P4-C6: Policy Distillation - depends on P4-C4 (now ready)

P4-C7 effectively concludes Part 4's AI for Robotics theme by integrating vision models, multi-modal understanding, learned control, and advanced RL into a complete language-to-action pipeline.
