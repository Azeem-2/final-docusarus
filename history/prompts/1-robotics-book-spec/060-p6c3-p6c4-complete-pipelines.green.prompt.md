### Task Status Updated

Updated `specs/1-robotics-book-spec/tasks.md`:
- **T186** now marked **complete**: P6-C3 has complete 6-agent pipeline
- **T187** now marked **complete**: P6-C4 has complete 6-agent pipeline

## Key Achievements

- **Comprehensive Projects**: Both chapters provide complete project guides integrating Parts 3 and 5 concepts
- **Simulation-First**: Emphasizes simulation-first development approach
- **Integration**: Excellent integration with Part 5 (P6-C3) and Parts 3+5 (P6-C4)
- **Correct Flow**: Followed mandatory 6-agent sequential pipeline exactly as specified

## Progress Summary

**Part 6 Status**:
- ✅ P6-C1: Build a Mobile Robot (complete from Pilot)
- ✅ P6-C2: Build a Robotic Arm (complete)
- ✅ P6-C3: Build a Humanoid Leg in Simulation (complete)
- ✅ P6-C4: Full Humanoid Digital Twin (complete)
- ⏳ P6-C5: RL-Based Locomotion Project (research complete, pipeline ready)
