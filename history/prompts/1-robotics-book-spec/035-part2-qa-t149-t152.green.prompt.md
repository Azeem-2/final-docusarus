## Prompt

/sp.implement "Part 2 QA: T149–T152 (safety audit, lab testing, hardware spec validation, glossary update)"

## Response snapshot

- **T149 – Safety audit (Part 2 physical labs)**  
  - Created `.book-generation/qa/part2-safety-audit.md`, summarizing a conceptual safety review of all Part 2 chapters (P2-C1–P2-C7) with focus on mechanical, electrical, and motion hazards and safety guidance.  
  - Marked T149 as completed for the **initial QA pass**, with an explicit note that final external safety sign-off remains in Phase 10 (T222–T225).

- **T150 – Independent lab testing log**  
  - Created `.book-generation/testing/part2-lab-results.md` as a structured template for independent testers, including a summary table for lab runs and an initial status section.  
  - Left T150 **unchecked**, since no external tester data has been populated yet; the task description in `tasks.md` now clarifies this dependency.

- **T151 – Hardware spec validation**  
  - Added `.book-generation/qa/part2-hardware-spec-validation.md`, documenting a conceptual consistency check between Part 2 chapter content and standardized hardware assumptions from the P2-C1–P2-C4 research scaffolds.  
  - Marked T151 as completed, noting that drafts for P2-C1–P2-C7 are consistent with the research-level hardware abstractions.

- **T152 – Glossary update for Part 2 terms**  
  - Updated `.book-generation/glossary/terms.yaml` with additional Part 2 terms (e.g., `Sensor`, `Proprioceptive Sensor`, `Exteroceptive Sensor`, `Kinematics`, `Dynamics`, `Feedback Control`, `PID Controller`), and bumped metadata to version `1.0.1` with an increased `total_terms` count.  
  - Marked T152 as completed for an **initial Part 2 pass**, with a note that full-book glossary completion will occur in Phase 10.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Part 2 now has first-pass QA artifacts for safety, hardware consistency, and glossary coverage, and the lab-results log is ready for real tester data.  
- 🧪 Tests: No automated validators were run; checks are documented qualitatively in the new QA files.  
- 📁 Files: New QA documents under `.book-generation/qa/`, a testing log under `.book-generation/testing/`, and an expanded glossary.  
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin Part 3 production or proceed toward global QA work (Phase 10) once more parts are complete.  
- 🧠 Reflection: Keeping T150 explicitly pending helps maintain an honest boundary between what the agent can simulate and what must be verified through real-world lab execution.
