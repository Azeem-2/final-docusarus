- Scraped robotsguide.com pages for Figure 01 and Atlas (detailed specifications)
- Attempted Tesla AI page (access denied, but search results provided information)
- Identified key concepts: analysis framework, robot specifications, design philosophies, comparative analysis

**Phase 2: Outliner-Agent** ✓
- Created 10-section chapter outline covering analysis framework, individual robot analyses, and comparative analysis

**Phase 3: Chapter-Structure-Architect** ✓
- Created structural blueprint with 3 lessons

**Phase 4: Lesson-Planner** ✓
- Created 3 detailed lesson blueprints

**Phase 5: Writer-Agent** ✓
- Created ~1,800-word draft covering: analysis framework, Tesla Optimus, Figure 01, Boston Dynamics Atlas, comparative analysis (design, capabilities, applications), lessons learned

**Phase 6: Book-Editor** ✓
- Created review: `ApprovedWithMinorRevisions` (88/100)

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Created systematic analysis framework and applied it to three leading robots
- **Integration**: Excellent integration with all Part 5 chapters, demonstrating practical application
- **Correct Flow**: Followed mandatory 6-agent sequential pipeline exactly as specified

## Progress Summary

**Part 5 is now COMPLETE** with all 7 chapters fully pipelined:
- P5-C1: Humanoid Kinematics & Dynamics (complete from Pilot)
- P5-C2: Bipedal Locomotion (complete)
- P5-C3: Balance & Stability (complete)
- P5-C4: Manipulation & Dexterity (complete)
- P5-C5: Human–Robot Interaction (complete)
- P5-C6: Safety Systems (complete)
