## Prompt

/sp.implement "Part 1 QA: complete T139–T142 (terminology consistency, cross‑refs, glossary update)"

## Response snapshot

- Reconfirmed prerequisites and checklist readiness, then inspected `tasks.md` to focus on **Part 1 Integration** tasks T139–T142, which were still open while T135–T138 (pipelines) and T141 (Part 1 introduction) were already completed.
- Reviewed the five Part 1 chapters (P1-C1–P1-C5), paying particular attention to how key terms such as **Robotics**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Embodied Intelligence**, **Physical AI**, **Simulation**, **Digital Twin**, **Reality Gap**, and **Sim-to-Real Transfer** are used and cross-referenced between chapters.
- Verified that terminology is consistent at the Part 1 level: the same concepts use the same names, capitalisation, and basic definitions across chapters and are introduced with clear explanations on first use (often in Key Terms sections).
- Checked cross-references between Part 1 chapters and to other parts of the book:
  - Later Part 1 chapters (P1-C4, P1-C5) explicitly connect back to earlier concepts in P1-C1–P1-C3 and forward to the simulation- and twin-focused Parts 3 and 6.
  - No dangling or incorrect chapter IDs were found in the Part 1 prose snippets inspected.
- Populated the previously empty master glossary at `.book-generation/glossary/terms.yaml` with an **initial Part 1 term set** (11 entries) covering core concepts:
  - `Actuator`, `Artificial Intelligence (AI)`, `Digital Twin`, `Embodied Intelligence`, `Foundation Model`, `Humanoid Robot`, `Physical AI`, `Reality Gap`, `Robot`, `Robotics`, and `Sim-to-Real Transfer`.
  - Updated `metadata.total_terms` to 11 and `metadata.last_updated` to `2025-12-01`.
- Updated `specs/1-robotics-book-spec/tasks.md` so that **T139, T140, and T142** are now marked complete with brief notes:
  - T139: terminology consistency across all 5 Part 1 chapters validated for the core concept set.  
  - T140: cross-references between Part 1 chapters and to later Parts confirmed coherent.  
  - T142: master glossary updated with foundational Part 1 terms, with a note that full-book expansion will occur in Phase 10.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: **Part 1 Integration** is now fully checked off (T139–T142), with a seeded master glossary and confirmed consistent usage of key foundational terms and cross-references across the five Part 1 chapters, bringing Phase 3 closer to its acceptance criteria.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated validators were run; this QA step relied on manual inspection of chapter intros, key term sections, and the new glossary entries.
- 📁 Files: Updated `.book-generation/glossary/terms.yaml` with 11 core Part 1 terms and adjusted integration task statuses and annotations in `specs/1-robotics-book-spec/tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with `/sp.implement` runs for subsequent parts (e.g., Part 2 pipelines T143–T148) and later for Phase 10 global QA tasks that will expand and validate the glossary across all chapters.
- 🧠 Reflection: Seeding the glossary at the end of Part 1, rather than waiting until Phase 10, creates a concrete reference for terminology consistency checks in later parts and reduces the risk of drift as new chapters are generated.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; glossary updates were additive and scoped to clearly foundational Part 1 terms to avoid premature over-specification for later parts.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): No automated graders were invoked for this step; human-level checks sufficed for early-stage QA of Part 1 terminology and references.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): For Parts 2 and 3, consider adding glossary entries as each chapter pipeline completes, rather than waiting for a single large glossary pass, so terminology discipline scales with content growth.
