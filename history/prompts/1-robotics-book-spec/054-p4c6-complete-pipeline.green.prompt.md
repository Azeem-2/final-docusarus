## User Request

Continue with P4-C6 (Policy Distillation) to complete Part 4.

## Work Completed

### P4-C6 (Policy Distillation) - Complete 6-Agent Pipeline ✓

**Phase 1: Research-Agent** ✓
- Created research scaffold
- Attempted MCP Context7 documentation from `/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl` (fetch failed, but research scaffold created with knowledge of RSL-RL)
- Identified key concepts: policy distillation, teacher-student framework, behavioral cloning, feature matching, logit matching, privileged information, progressive distillation

**Phase 2: Outliner-Agent** ✓
- Created 10-section chapter outline

**Phase 3: Chapter-Structure-Architect** ✓
- Created structural blueprint with 3 lessons

**Phase 4: Lesson-Planner** ✓
- Created 3 detailed lesson blueprints

**Phase 5: Writer-Agent** ✓
- Created ~1,600-word draft covering: policy distillation, teacher-student framework, distillation methods (behavioral cloning, feature matching, logit matching), privileged information, progressive distillation, deployment

**Phase 6: Book-Editor** ✓
- Created review: `ApprovedWithMinorRevisions` (87/100)

**Phase 7: Diagrams + Manuscript Copy** ✓
- Created 4 Mermaid diagrams
- Created manuscript chapter

### Task Status Updated

Updated `specs/1-robotics-book-spec/tasks.md`:
- **T168** now marked **complete**: P4-C6 has complete 6-agent pipeline

## Key Achievements

- **Correct Flow**: Followed mandatory 6-agent sequential pipeline exactly as specified
- **Part 4 Completion**: P4-C6 completes all 7 chapters of Part 4 (AI for Robotics)
- **Integration**: Effectively integrates with P4-C3 (control policies), P4-C4 (RL advanced), P3-C7 (sim-to-real)

## Progress Summary

**Part 4 is now COMPLETE** with all 7 chapters fully pipelined:
- P4-C1: Vision Models (complete from Pilot)
- P4-C2: Multi-modal Models (complete)
- P4-C3: Control Policies (complete)
- P4-C4: Reinforcement Learning Advanced (complete)
- P4-C5: Trajectory Optimization (complete)
- P4-C6: Policy Distillation (complete)
- P4-C7: Language-to-Action Systems (complete)

All Part 4 chapters are ready for final QA (citations, glossary updates, global validators).

**Next Phase**: Part 4 Quality Assurance (T170-T173) or proceed to Part 5 production.
